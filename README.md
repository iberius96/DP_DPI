# Description of the domain of interest

The proposed project is shaped on the data collected for the Climate Risk Planning \& Managing Tool for Development Programmes in the Agriculture \& Food 
Sector (CRISP) project funded by the Deutsche Gesellschaft f√ºr Internationale Zusammenarbeit GmbH. 

Important in the understanding of the presented data is the concept of **Farming Systems**, which are described in 
[Dixon and Gibbon](http://www.international-food-safety.com/pdf/GFSS.pdf) as: *"populations of farms that have broadly similar resource bases, enterprise 
patterns, household livelihoods and constraints, and for which similar development strategies and interventions would be appropriate. The biophysical, 
economic and human elements of a farm are interdependent, and thus farms can be analysed as systems from various points of view. [...] Regardless of 
their size, individual farm systems are organised to produce food and meet other goals through the management of available resources [...] within the 
existing social, economic and institutional environment"*.

The presented data seeks to describe farming systems belonging to different macro regions (the broad definitions of which can be found in [Dixon and Gibbon](http://www.international-food-safety.com/pdf/GFSS.pdf))
using the concepts and terminology related to the impact chain method developed by the Eurac Climate and Disaster Research Group and described in the 
corresponding vulnerability sourcebook and risk supplement. In this context, another relevant notion is the one of **Impact Chain Models**, which are 
described in Zebisch, 2021 as: *"conceptual models describing climate impact as cause-effect relationships within a socio-ecological system"* and, in even
simpler terms, are defined in the risk supplement document as: *"analytical tool[s] that help you better understand, systemise and prioritise the 
factors that drive vulnerability in the system under review"*. 

In this context, the underlying data associated with each given farming system presents the relevant **Factors** (which can be seen as the building blocks 
for the Impact Chain Model) and ties them together by means of a set of *Connections*.

Additionally, a wide array of indicators are provided with the purpose of describing in detail the farming system at hand. Such indicators include 
information on livelihood sources, produced commodities, landscapes, related countries, etc.

Finally, much of the presented data is associated with **bibliographic resources**, which allow to tie a piece of information to its original formulation.

# Dataset format

The initial dataset related to the project at hand is made up of a set of 22 **.xlsx** files, each containing information related to an individual farming system. The data has been privately shared for the completion of this project.
