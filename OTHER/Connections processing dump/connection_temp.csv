","Seasonal river flooding, which coincides with the rainy season that runs from May to November, plays a critical role in the health of the Mekong river system. These floods deposit sediments, which improve soil fertility, flush out polluted waters, and recharge the groundwater tables. However, excessive flooding during the rainy season are becoming more frequent, and structural elements are not expected to hold up under an increasingly severe climate regime, which is driving sea-level rise (SLR) and changing meteorological and hydrological conditions.Changes in climate are also causing flooding and drought in Lao PDR","CCAFS,2016Nguyen et al., 2017,Thuy Le Toan, et al, 2021Chapman & Darby, 2016,Ling et al.","2015",,"3"

For example, Chile’s hydrological regulation capacity lacks coordination between institutions and is challenged by data deficits. The number of groundwater rights granted increased by 4,350% between 2001 and 2017 which resulted in decreases in groundwater levels. Furthermore, the expansion of irrigated agriculture in Mexico has led to aquifer overexploitation and declines in regional groundwater levels.","Donoso","2021","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/357814386_Management_of_Water_Resources_in_Agriculture_in_Chile_and_its_Challenges
