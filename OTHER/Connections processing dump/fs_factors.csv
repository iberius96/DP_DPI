1,"Increase in average temperatures","Lowland Rice",EAP,"Hazard","Increase in Temperature of 0.02-0.03 °C per year by 2050 across the entire region is expected"
2,"Rising sea levels","Lowland Rice",EAP,"Hazard","The tides are rising at a rate close to ~2 cm/year, and salinity has increased by approximately 0.2–0.5 PSU/year.  Sea levels are expected to rise in the region by 45-75 cm by 2090.  Average sea level rise of 3 mm per year over the last 30 years . This is a major threat to a part of the world which, on average, is less than 2 metres above sea level."
3,"Increase in drought events","Lowland Rice",EAP,"Hazard","The risk of drought often occurs during the Winter-Spring rice crops, particularly in El Niño years. Severe drought years such as 1977–1978, 1997–1998, 2015–2016 and 2019–2020 are all related to El Niño events, which greatly affect production and life in the Mekong Delta. During low river flow periods, between March and April, saline water intrudes up to 40–50 km inland from estuaries through main river systems  and about 100,000 ha of rice annually is at high risk of dry-season salinity intrusion."
4,"Increase in average precipitation","Lowland Rice",EAP,"Hazard","In recent years, farmers in many provinces have had to readjust the crop calendar, to rotate rice with short-term crops, or to convert their rice land to aquaculture. It is worth noting that the rate of increase in aquaculture area in the Mekong Delta experienced an important surge after El Ninõ 2015–2016 (mean annual increase of 18.3 T ha in 2016–2019, as compared to 4.25 T ha in 2008–2015). Rainfall has increased at the end of the rainy season but decreased at the beginning of the rainy season over the last 10 years. Shifting rainfall patterns such as these can have an adverse effect on the agricultural productivity of the Mekong Delta. A 30% annual increase in precipitation has been observed."
5,"Decrease in average precipitation","Lowland Rice",EAP,"Hazard","The temperature has increased, annual rainfall has decreased and is distributed less evenly, and the dry season lasts longer. Results indicate a significant downward trend in rainfall in the Kien Giang, Soc Trang, and Ca Mau provinces, where the rice-growing areas are mainly based on rainfall. Therefore, these areas have a potential risk of water shortages, resulting in increased production costs especially during the winter-spring crop season, and a rice productivity decline, which would indirectly contribute to threatening the food security of the region and Vietnam as a whole."
6,"Saline intrusion","Lowland Rice",EAP,"Impact","The risks of increasing saline intrusion and permanent inundation due to sea level rise, will significantly reduce the land suitable for rice cultivation in the Mekong delta by 50 % by 2050. Coastal provinces are strongly affected by saline intrusion from the second half of December to the end of April. Recently, saline intrusions tend to occur earlier, with increased salinity concentrations and duration, and are more invasive in the fields. Salinity intrusion is associated with low water discharge from upstream of the Mekong River. This is caused by the below average rainfall in the Mekong basin due to the El Niño. With insufficient upstream water flow to push back seawater, salinity intrusion increased in concentration and duration. It was also aggravated by the drought and high temperature in the region. Salinity intrusion is also caused by the construction of dams further upstream on the Mekong River and dams on the lower Mekong River, which reduce water flow and prevent the renewal of the delta silt deposits."
7,"Shorter growing seasons","Lowland Rice",EAP,"Impact","In recent years, farmers in many provinces have had to readjust the crop calendar, to rotate rice with short-term crops, or to convert their rice land to aquaculture. It is worth noting that the rate of increase in aquaculture area in the Mekong Delta experienced an important surge after El Ninõ 2015–2016 (mean annual increase of 18.3 T ha in 2016–2019, as compared to 4.25 T ha in 2008–2015)."
8,"Increased flooding","Lowland Rice",EAP,"Impact","Seasonal river flooding, which coincides with the rainy season that runs from May to November, plays a critical role in the health of the Mekong river system. These floods deposit sediments, which improve soil fertility, flush out polluted waters, and recharge the groundwater tables. However, excessive flooding during the rainy season are becoming more frequent, and structural elements are not expected to hold up under an increasingly severe climate regime, which is driving sea-level rise (SLR) and changing meteorological and hydrological conditions. Chnages in climate are also causing flooding and drought in Lao PDR "
9,"Water scarcity","Lowland Rice",EAP,"Impact","The Mekong Delta is one of a number of localised agricultural regions in the world that face acute water risks, which we have identified as water-risk “hotspots” that require a targeted policy response. These water risks are not only the result of climate change but involve a range of factors, including farming itself, that cause water shortages, floods and degradation of water quality, extensive dam-building and ground water pumping."
10,"Reduced crop productivity/failure","Lowland Rice",EAP,"Impact","Climate change by 2050 will cause a significant reduction in rice yield, but the projections  depend on the rice crop season and the geographical area. Vast tracks of land planted with rice are affected by salinity intrusion and drought at the reproductive stage. Yields were reduced by 50-100%, or total loss. Shifting rainfall patterns  have an adverse effect on the agricultural productivity of the Mekong Delta.  Estimates of changes in crop productivity due to climate change are in the range of 2-30% over a 20-30 year period."

19,"Coastal inundation","Lowland Rice",EAP,"Impact","A rise in the sea level of only 30 cm could see the loss of nearly 200,000 hectares of rice cultivation."
20,"Increase in food spoilage/wastage","Lowland Rice",EAP,"Impact","The emergence of severe droughts in the Mekong Delta has resulted in huge crop failures, with 90% of sowed fields perishing in the drought-impacted regions.This devastating drought damaged up to 30% of 29,900 ha rice in2019"
21,"Increase in food insecurity","Lowland Rice",EAP,"Impact","Frequent droughts and reduced crop productivity in various countries is increasing the threats of food insecurity."
22,"Dependence on food aid","Lowland Rice",EAP,"Impact","Vietnam recorded an extreme drought event in 2019 in 5 of 13 provinces in the Mekong Delta, and an emergency was declared. New Zealand Embassy announced humanitarian aid, totalling US$50,000, to communities in Ben Tre Province affected by drought and saltwater intrusion."
23,"Limited uptake of modern technologies","Lowland Rice",EAP,"Vulnerability","The capacity of agencies to provide accurate information for drought and salinity forecasting and early warning systems is limited. The distribution of updated information on salinity levels is slow. In Vietnam, it takes a long time until salinity measurements reach the farmers. Collected information has to first be elevated to and approved by high-level decision makers before it is distributed to the local level. Thus, farmers get outdated information on salinity. It would be beneficial if the process would be smoother and the information flow more direct without passing many entities."
24,"Unsustainable natural resource use","Lowland Rice",EAP,"Vulnerability","Sand mining is commonly practiced in along Mekong Delta"
25,"Unsustainable land management practices","Lowland Rice",EAP,"Vulnerability","On-farm deterioration in the quality of rice for sale, due to poor post-harvest management practices and inadequate storage conditions, is very significant in many areas and leads to reduced revenues from crop sales"
26,"Dependence on groundwater","Lowland Rice",EAP,"Vulnerability",
27,"Major component of local diet","Lowland Rice",EAP,"Vulnerability","Rice, the main staple of the Vietnamese diet, occupies 94% of arable land, is cultivated in all regions, and is the top crop in terms of planted area in 5 of the regions. Lowland rice farmin is also the main occupation for rural people in Savannakhet Province in Laos."
28,"Inconsistencies in policy implementation","Lowland Rice",EAP,"Vulnerability","Inconsistencies were observed in subsidy policies being implemented. During the winter spring season, farmers were recommended to reduce their planted areas to avoid losses. However, subsidies were only provided to farmers who had planted rice regardless of the warnings. The farmers who followed the recommendations did not receive any subsidy and/or support."
29,"Large contributor to national GDP","Lowland Rice",EAP,"Vulnerability","The Mekong River Delta (MRD) is the rice basket of Vietnam producing 56% of the total domestic rice production and accounting for 90% of Vietnam’s rice export. Over 1.7 million hectares of land, more than half of the total arable land in the region, are being used for rice production."
30,"Low access to markets","Lowland Rice",EAP,"Vulnerability"," Developing markets for by-products  such as rice straws could be one option to reduce vulnerability of the farmers to salinity intrusion. "
31,"Unfavourable soil conditions","Lowland Rice",EAP,"Vulnerability","Elicited by the El Niño, the drought has resulted in effects, such as reduced agricultural production, which limit the livelihoods and aggravates food insecurity in poor and vulnerable communities."
32,"Water scarce area","Lowland Rice",EAP,"Vulnerability","Elicited by the El Niño, the drought has resulted in effects, such as reduced agricultural production, which limit the livelihoods and aggravates food insecurity in poor and vulnerable communities."
33,"Fragmented landscapes","Lowland Rice",EAP,"Vulnerability","Increasing fragmentation of farmland has resulted from a growing agricultural population and the absence of primogeniture to maintain the integrity of holdings. In many instances farm sizes are now uneconomic, and even with the adoption of best practices would still only be marginal in terms of livelihood. If this trend is not reversed, an increasing proportion of farmers will be unable to rely on agriculture to ensure adequate food security and income levels. As a consequence, on-farm employment, and even complete exit from the system (e.g. permanent migration to urban areas), is likely to occur on a much larger scale."
34,"Lack of irrigation infrastructure ","Lowland Rice",EAP,"Vulnerability","Lack of irrigation water is affecting productivity in the lowland system. For instance, the low yield in Winter-Spring rice in Tra Vinh could be linked to the lack of irrigation water and saline intrusion during the dry season."
35,"Barrier to natural flows due to  infrastructure ","Lowland Rice",EAP,"Vulnerability","Hydropower dam construction forms barrier to flow of water and sediment. "
36,"Lack of access to improved crop varieties","Lowland Rice",EAP,"Vulnerability","Farmers’ knowledge and adoption of salinity- and drought-tolerant rice varieties is also limited, as these have seedling stage tolerance and are appropriate for the spring-summer cropping."
37,"Lack of access to improved crop varieties","Lowland Rice",EAP,"Vulnerability","In most countries, seed is generally of poor quality and not necessarily of the most recently recommended variety, because most farmers retain their own seed for replanting for many seed generations. While research services and private companies have developed new crop varieties - including hybrids - with higher yield potential and better local adaptability, they are often unavailable to the majority of farmers or are unsuited to their production practices. Production of seed of improved rice varieties is undertaken in many countries by government services, but quantities are generally much less than required by farmers. This situation has a serious adverse effect on crop yield and overall crop production."
38,"Inadequate climate information services","Lowland Rice",EAP,"Vulnerability",
39,"Poor efficiency of farming","Lowland Rice",EAP,"Vulnerability",
40,"Dependent on a single crop type","Lowland Rice",EAP,"Vulnerability",
41,"Small farm size","Lowland Rice",EAP,"Vulnerability"," Farm sizes are becoming uneconomic, and even with the adoption of best practices would still only be marginal in terms of livelihood. If the trend continues, an increasing proportion of farmers will be unable to rely on agriculture to ensure adequate food security and income levels."
42,"Invest in irrigation infrastructure","Lowland Rice",EAP,"Adaptation option","Promote appropriate water management practices during periods of high salinity (i.e. based on EC testing of irrigation water) in addition to use of salt tolerant, short maturing rice varieties. Manage upstream flow of the Mekong River. It is very important to maintain upstream flows in the future through upstream flow management."
43,"Structural adjustments","Lowland Rice",EAP,"Adaptation option","Resident are adjusting house conditions to cope with the floods. The adaptation measures include construction of storey buildings and elevation above ground level.  Construction of dykes to control the floods and saline water intrusion."
44,"Invest in water harvesting and storage infrastructure","Lowland Rice",EAP,"Adaptation option","Explore the method of underground taming of floods for irrigation (UTFI) proposed by IWMI (http://utfi.iwmi.org/) as an alternative for increasing the groundwater volume for irrigation in the dry season and reducing the damage by floods during heavy rains."
45,"Diversify livelihoods","Lowland Rice",EAP,"Adaptation option","Traditional rice-based farming systems in the region have always been diversified but cropping intensity was mostly low. Farmers have grown various food and non-food crops and raised livestock mainly to meet their domestic needs  Some of the practices in diversifying farming systems included livestock, horticulture, annual and perennial trees combined with livestock. These however depend on a stable supply of water for irrigation.  "
46,"Implement water conservation irrigation","Lowland Rice",EAP,"Adaptation option","Promote appropriate water management practices during periods of high salinity (i.e. based on EC testing of irrigation water) in addition to use of salt tolerant, short maturing rice varieties. Manage upstream flow of the Mekong River. It is very important to maintain upstream flows in the future through upstream flow management. Explore the method of underground taming of floods for irrigation (UTFI) proposed by IWMI (http://utfi.iwmi.org/) as an alternative for increasing the groundwater volume for irrigation in the dry season and reducing the damage by floods during heavy rains."
47,"Implement climate smart agriculture practices","Lowland Rice",EAP,"Adaptation option","Up-scale of CSA and CSV concepts to improve the resilience and adaptive capacities of local communities to extreme climate events. This should also be considered part of medium- and long-term measures. Improve/adopt sustainable resource management practices (water, soil, and crop management). In the three provinces visited, farmers extracted and over-used freshwater illegally, which can reduce freshwater availability for vulnerable communities in coastal areas. Trial, and if successful, out-scale insurance (e.g. weather-index based, remote sensing-based) programmes to protect smallholder farmers and agricultural businesses."
48,"Adopt drought tolerant varieties","Lowland Rice",EAP,"Adaptation option","Farmers’ knowledge and adoption of salinity- and drought-tolerant rice varieties is also limited, as these have seedling stage tolerance and are appropriate for the spring-summer cropping. Design a forward-looking breeding program for the development of new ‛designer’ varieties that fit the new cropping systems and carry the package of traits required for  climate resilience. These varieties should have optimum maturing periods (duration) based on available windows of opportunities and should also combine tolerance of current and foreseen abiotic stresses, such as salinity, drought and heat stress."
49,"Improve climate change awareness","Lowland Rice",EAP,"Adaptation option","Many local farmers do not follow warnings and instructions of local authorities based on rice cultivation calendars, climate and weather forecasts. This requires building mutual trust between farmers, local officers and researchers, providing consistent agro-advisories and supporting policies, and integrating local knowledge in response scenarios to seasonal weather forecasts."
50,"Adjust crop calendar","Lowland Rice",EAP,"Adaptation option","Determine the cut-off date for Dong Xuan season (i.e. the latest date of harvest of Dong Xuan) to avoid late season salinity. Vietnam has successfully implemented the cut-off date to avoid flooding/submergence in flood prone area, and a similar approach should be applied to saline areas."
51,"Invest in agricultural research and development","Lowland Rice",EAP,"Adaptation option","Integrated form of participatory research and extension should be developed and promoted, with less emphasis on single-crop research. This would benefit from synergies between productive activities, and would consider the whole-farm production system - including the sustainability of natural resources and the protection of the environment. Specific support should be given to the development of research resources, both equipment and human resources, to take advantage of new techniques in biotechnology and genetic engineering."
52,"Plant multiple varieties","Lowland Rice",EAP,"Adaptation option",
53,"Implement efficient water management","Lowland Rice",EAP,"Adaptation option","Implement water-saving technologies in upstream provinces (e.g. An Giang, Can Tho, Dong Thap) to reduce water withdrawal and allow for higher water flow to coastal provinces. This would reduce salinity intrusion in the region. "
54,"Build the capacity of agricultural extension agents","Lowland Rice",EAP,"Adaptation option","The capacity of  agencies to provide accurate information for drought and salinity forecasting and early warning systems is limited. This is aggravated by poor mechanisms for coordination, sharing of data and standardization of collected data among relevant ministries, line departments, local authorities, farmers and water users. For example, different teams from provincial departments are doing the  monitoring of water quality in the provinces, but data from these teams could not combined with salinity monitoring at commune levels because of problems in coordination and inconsistence in monitoring methods. "
55,"Improve access to climate information services","Lowland Rice",EAP,"Adaptation option","Existing national, regional and provincial salinity information systems are effective for managing irrigation infrastructure to access both saline and fresh water at the macro level. However information is insufficient to warn rice growers in time when water management infrastructure fails or is unable to protect their fields. If farmers measure and disseminate information about salinity variability in their immediate environment in cooperation with local authorities, communities can make collective decisions and put strategies in place to minimize the risks of salinity intrusion in their rice fields. A real-time salinity monitoring and advisory service in selected salinity-affected communities is needed."
56,"Develop/improve early warning systems","Lowland Rice",EAP,"Adaptation option","The development of an improved climate monitoring and early warning system should be prioritized to help mitigate negative impacts induced by climate change in the Mekong Delta. These can also be used to disseminate technical advisories for drought and salinity preparedness, and recommended adaptation measures (e.g. cut-off dates for rice transplanting/sowing or rearing shrimp, suitable drought and saline tolerant varieties, appropriate farming techniques and practices)."
57,"Build capacity on usage of climate information","Lowland Rice",EAP,"Adaptation option","The capacity of agencies to provide accurate information for drought and salinity forecasting and early warning systems is limited. This is aggravated by poor mechanisms for coordination, sharing of data and standardization of collected data among relevant ministries, line departments, local authorities, farmers and water users. For example, different teams from provincial departments are doing the roving monitoring of water quality in the provinces, but data from these teams could not combined with salinity monitoring at commune levels because of problems in coordination and inconsistence in monitoring methods. "
58,"Improve interprovincial interventions","Lowland Rice",EAP,"Adaptation option","In the MRD, agriculture production of adjacent provinces is interlinked to each other through their land use decisions, water sharing scheme, and farming practice. For example, water holding strategy of upstream provinces may lead to water shortages in downstream regions, or improper shrimp farming techniques of coastal regions may result in intrusion of saline water in rice lands."
59,"Develop policies for building climate change resilience","Lowland Rice",EAP,"Adaptation option"," For sustainable rice production in the system, changing cropping calendar and system cannot be done alone but have to be implemented together with structural measures, water saving technologies, tolerant varieties, and policy and institution. "
60,"Improve access to input/output markets","Lowland Rice",EAP,"Adaptation option","Maintaining rice production under the increasing impact of climate change, reducing input costs through large scale mechanization and irrigation management and ensuring the stable market price are the major priorities of the farmers, managers and policy makers."
61,"Farmers engaged in agri system","Lowland Rice",EAP,"Exposure","The MRD covers an area of about 39,000 km. With a total population of 17.5 million people (about 19% of the national population).

177,"Loss of income","Upland Intensive Mixed",EAP,"Impact","Farming households in the upland intensive mixed farming system are typically poor, thus losses of income associated with poor yields are expected to push them further into poverty. "
178,"Limited uptake of modern technologies","Upland Intensive Mixed",EAP,"Vulnerability","Farmers in East Asia  tend to be conservative and prefer to use traditional methods. In addition, technology development typically focuses on specific commodities, rather than on integrated development of a system  that takes into account various land use options and different agro-ecological zones. "
179,"Unsustainable land management practices","Upland Intensive Mixed",EAP,"Vulnerability","Shifting cultivation has historically been the main land use system of upland rural villages. Two to ten year rotations are applied and the major crop, upland rice, is cultivated with no external inputs or mechanisation. However, this is changing in many areas as farming is becoming market-oriented with shorter fallow periods, some permanent fields, and the use of irrigation and inputs. With the more intensive production and shorter fallow periods, soil fertility is declining and production is being adversely affected, rendering the system ecologically unsustainable. This change has come about mainly due to demographic pressure and land-use restrictions. "
180,"Unequal opportunities for women ","Upland Intensive Mixed",EAP,"Vulnerability","Women tend to be marginalised in the upland intensive mixed agricultural system despite the vital role they play. Traditionally, women are responsible for tasks such as transplanting, weeding and harvesting, while men work in land preparation, crop management and marketing. Women are often excluded from decision-making roles and are paid less than men for the same work. Further, land ownership by women is rare, so their work is largely unrecognised."
181,"Weak land tenure ","Upland Intensive Mixed",EAP,"Vulnerability","Land tenure is typically weak in the upland intensive mixed system. Land tenure, land leasing and land markets are policy issues that have to be reviewed to promote agricultural development in upland areas."
182,"Weak land tenure and access rights for women","Upland Intensive Mixed",EAP,"Vulnerability","Land ownership by women is rare, so their work is largely unrecognised and they cannot access finance, extension services or other technical support. Even when national laws allocate equal rights to own and control land, social norms and customary laws tend to prevent it."
183,"Low access to credit","Upland Intensive Mixed",EAP,"Vulnerability","Smallholder farmers within the agricultural system generally lack access to formal credit sources, particularly the poorer households and women farmers."
184,"Large contributor to national/regional GDP","Upland Intensive Mixed",EAP,"Vulnerability","In recent years, agriculture has contributed less to regional GDP, however, it is still one of the top five contributing sectors and remains the key contributor for countries such as Laos. As agriculture is directly affected by climate change, a high dependency of national economies and societies on the sector puts them at risk. For example, three out of four poor people in Southeast Asia reside in rural areas and are dependent on agriculture."
185,"Lack of access to risk insurance","Upland Intensive Mixed",EAP,"Vulnerability","Farms in the upland intensive mixed farming system are remote and so access to risk insurance is low."
186,"High levels of deforestation","Upland Intensive Mixed",EAP,"Vulnerability","Government agencies and large timber companies have undertaken widespread and unsustainable logging of forested areas throughout the agricultural system. Areas of natural forest have decreased significantly in all East Asia countries. Further, demographic pressure has led to the clearing of land for agricultural activities. The high rates of deforestation have negative implications for local resilience and environmental feedback effects. "

190,"High prevalence of weeds","Upland Intensive Mixed",EAP,"Vulnerability","Rice crops are adversely affected by complex and diverse weed flora. Weeds are a major biological constraint limiting rice production worldwide."
191,"Inadequate agri research and development","Upland Intensive Mixed",EAP,"Vulnerability","In general, there is limited capacity to design, implement, monitor and evaluate relevant research. Documentation skills are lacking and there is limited sharing of research data and results. For example, the  quality of upland rice production data for Laos is insufficient to inform decision making. "
192,"Low access to agricultural extension services","Upland Intensive Mixed",EAP,"Vulnerability","Access to agricultural extension services is generally low in the agricultural system due to the large number of poor farmers with small plots in geographically dispersed communities with underdeveloped transport and communication infrastructure. The lack of access to extension services affects knowledge sharing on modern agricultural technology and practices. Women are typically excluded from access to critical productive resources such as  extension services and information."
193,"Lack of access to  inputs ","Upland Intensive Mixed",EAP,"Vulnerability","Due to the remoteness and widespread poverty within the agricultural system, farmers tend to lack capital for seeds, fertilisers, pesticides and wages to hire workers to plant and harvest crops. Women are typically excluded from access to critical productive resources and services such as credit, farm inputs, marketing facilities, extension and information."
194,"Low level of education","Upland Intensive Mixed",EAP,"Vulnerability","Due to the remoteness of the upland intensive mixed farming system, education levels are generally low as school attendance requires commuting. For example the household heads of two villages engaged in upland agriculture in Laos, namely, Ko Ngiaw and Navene, 43% and 21% had completed secondary-level education, respectively. It was noted that the farmers with higher levels of education possessed greater adaptive capacity."
195,"Low levels of climate change awareness at the farmer level","Upland Intensive Mixed",EAP,"Vulnerability","In general, farmers in South East Asia are aware of climate change due to information gathered from newspapers, the internet, television, advertisements, and their community and friends. However, in the more remote areas of the upland intensive agricultural system, access to information, and therefore farmers' climate change awareness, is typically lower. "
196,"Demographic pressure on land","Upland Intensive Mixed",EAP,"Vulnerability","The East Asian and Pacific Islands region has a total population of 660.6 million, and is growing annually at 1.08% on average. Indonesia is the most populous country, followed by the Philippines, then Vietnam. Population growth is a known driver of land use change in the mountainous areas of the region."
197,"Reliance on rainfed agriculture","Upland Intensive Mixed",EAP,"Vulnerability","Less than 25% of farms in the upland intensive mixed system are irrigated."
198,"Lack of road infrastructure","Upland Intensive Mixed",EAP,"Vulnerability","Farms in the agricultural system tend to be remote with limited to no road access. The lack of transportation facilities and related low access to information and support services (credit facilities, extension services) are often highlighted as major obstacles to agricultural development in the upland areas."
199,"Limited uptake of modern technologies","Upland Intensive Mixed",EAP,"Vulnerability","In general, East Asian farmers lack the skills and technology required to adapt to the increasing rate of climate instability and uncertainty. Uptake of modern technologies tends to be low due to a lack of access to information and services and a preference for traditional farming methods. "
200,"Weak land tenure and access rights, particularly for women","Upland Intensive Mixed",EAP,"Vulnerability",
201,"High poverty levels ","Upland Intensive Mixed",EAP,"Vulnerability","The upland intensive mixed farming system is characterised by high poverty levels. Upland households experience a much higher rate of chronic poverty than lowland households. For example, a survey of 300 households in Thailand and Vietnam classified 41% of the upland households as chronically poor, but only 3 % of the lowland households."
202,"Implement reforestation practices","Upland Intensive Mixed",EAP,"Adaptation option","Forested areas are scattered throughout the system, mainly at higher elevations. Development programmes should promote afforestation practices and community management of forested areas to enhance ecological goods and services for improved agricultural productivity and livelihood options."
203,"Invest in road infrastructure","Upland Intensive Mixed",EAP,"Adaptation option","Road networks are important catalysts for agricultural development as they improve accessibility to markets, services and support (i.e. bank institutions, education and extension services) and expand employment opportunities. "
204,"Invest in water harvesting and storage infrastructure","Upland Intensive Mixed",EAP,"Adaptation option","To enhance farmers' resilience to climate change there is a need to invest in improved watershed management, conservation farming, water harvesting and storage and the introduction of appropriate technologies."
205,"Improve climate change awareness","Upland Intensive Mixed",EAP,"Adaptation option","It is important that farmers undergo training to enhance their skills and techniques and increase their awareness of climate change. Resources, such as the internet, television and radio have proved useful knowledge sources for farmers' adaptation strategies."
206,"Capacity building on sustainable agricultural practices","Upland Intensive Mixed",EAP,"Adaptation option","Sustainable soil and water management practices should be promoted to improve crop yields and ensure maintenance of soil productivity."
207,"Implement agroforestry practices","Upland Intensive Mixed",EAP,"Adaptation option","Agroforestry is a key climate change adaptation strategy as it provides multiple harvests at different times of the year. The diverse combination of crops buffers farmers from the risk of income loss due to climate variability, price fluctuations and other unexpected problems. On steeper lands such as in the upland intensive mixed agricultural system, agroforestry should be promoted with contour planting of suitable tree species for production of fruits, timber, fuelwood and non-timber forest products."
208,"Plant multiple crop types","Upland Intensive Mixed",EAP,"Adaptation option","The planting of multiple crops, such as in agroforestry systems, shifts reliance from one or two annual crops to a range of food and income-generating crops, thus reducing vulnerability to climate shocks. Further, the planting of multiple crop types can reduce the incidence of pests and diseases."
209,"Invest in agricultural research and development","Upland Intensive Mixed",EAP,"Adaptation option","Government and researchers should engage farmers in local-level research, drawing upon their indigenous knowledge in the identification of climate change issues and co-developing adaptation means to meet their context-specific needs. "
210,"Integrated weed management","Upland Intensive Mixed",EAP,"Adaptation option","Integrated weed management (IWM) combines a variety of preventive, cultural, mechanical, and chemical practices to control weed infestations. Often a single weed management practice is not feasible due to the diversity of weed species and differing life cycles and survival strategies. "
211,"Build women's  capacity ","Upland Intensive Mixed",EAP,"Adaptation option","It is important to build the capacity of women and ethnic minorities to adopt appropriate agricultural innovations, and to understand how policies, social and biophysical constraints positively or negatively affect their development. "
212,"Plant cash crops","Upland Intensive Mixed",EAP,"Adaptation option","The integration of cash crops in upland livelihood strategies can increase household income levels and food security. Due to the remoteness of the farming system, emphasis needs to be placed on low weight, high value products that are easily transported, have a long shelf-life and can be processed locally to increase the market value. "
213,"Diversify to livestock value chains","Upland Intensive Mixed",EAP,"Adaptation option","Livestock products are an important source of household cash income in the agricultural system and there is considerable room for expanding production. However, focus must be placed on integrated livestock production systems and good livestock husbandry practices with improved access to animal health services."

220,"Improve access to agricultural extension services","Upland Intensive Mixed",EAP,"Adaptation option","There is substantial knowledge and technologies available for sustainable farming in the uplands but it rarely reaches the farmers. Extension agents are needed to strengthen the capabilities of farmers to improve their agricultural production and sustainably use forests. Developing a bond between the farmers and extension staff through effective extension activities is necessary for expanding the use of farming technologies. Participatory approaches such as farmer trainers’ can ensure widespread and rapid agricultural knowledge diffusion. "
221,"Improve access to climate information services","Upland Intensive Mixed",EAP,"Adaptation option","Access to climate information can be improved through media such as television and radio. "
222,"Policy reform","Upland Intensive Mixed",EAP,"Adaptation option","Climate change and gender equality needs to be mainstreamed into development strategies and plans and adaptation action needs to be translated into development plans at national and local levels."

In Colombia, deforestation increased by 14% between 2015 and 2016, and doubled between 2016 and 2017. In Brazil’s Legal Amazon, deforestation increased by 8.5% between 2017 and 2018."
454,"Unfavourable soil conditions","Forest based Livestock ",LAC,"Vulnerability","Soils in the Amazon rainforest are poorly suited to growing crops for extended periods of time as they tend to be nutrient deficient, acidic soils, and in some areas are eroded due to poor land use management practices. "
455,"Frequent forest fires","Forest based Livestock ",LAC,"Vulnerability","Fire is routinely used to clear forest for agricultural production, and in conjunction with increasing temperatures and drought, has been identified as a direct driver of deforestation in the Amazon. For example, in 2020, warm and dry conditions were experienced in the southern Amazon, resulting in 600,000 individual fire events, including 25 fires that were larger than 500 square kilometres in Bolivia, Brazil, and Paraguay. Deforestation fire activity increased in the southern Amazon area by 23% from 2019 to 2020, and active fire detections from understory fires were 60% higher than in 2019."
456,"Low access to markets","Forest based Livestock ",LAC,"Vulnerability","In remote areas of the Amazon, smallholder farmers lack access to markets due to inadequate road infrastructure."

459,"Invest in road infrastructure","Forest based Livestock ",LAC,"Adaptation option","Smallholder farmers in remote areas of the Amazon can benefit from the construction of new private roads. Although improved road access, when coupled with weak law enforcement, can lead to increased deforestation, it is also crucial to increasing smallholders’ access to markets and other services."
460,"Implement agroforestry practices","Forest based Livestock ",LAC,"Adaptation option","Agroforestry is a valuable climate change adaptation option for forest-agriculture frontiers.  Agroforestry improves soil fertility, increases water availability, provides vegetation cover and maintains the microclimate. Furthermore, agroforestry has the potential to recover degraded lands and is an economically viable approach that can be integrated in grain, non-timber forest products and beef production systems. "
461,"Implement climate smart agriculture practices","Forest based Livestock ",LAC,"Adaptation option","The climate smart agriculture practice of integrated crop–livestock management is a potential means to improve the productivity and sustainability of cattle production in the Amazon. For example, integrated soybean–cattle systems have higher productivity than continuously grazed areas. Silvopastoral systems are another climate smart approach to improving agricultural productivity. Silvopastoral systems provide shade, reducing body temperatures of grazing cattle by up to 4˚C compared with pasture-only systems. Some examples of climate smart pasture management options include not exceeding land carrying capacity, planting drought tolerant fodder crops (e.g. BRS Paiaguas), no tillage, intercropping of grasses and legumes for pasture diversification, and implementing manure management systems for improved soil quality."
462,"Diversify to horticulture","Forest based Livestock ",LAC,"Adaptation option","Specialty crops such as citrus, black pepper, and vegetables were found to provide up to 10 times higher returns than other land uses in the Brazilian Amazon. However, such crops require good access to urban areas and processing, storage and supply infrastructure. Despite the potential long-term profitability, high start-up costs can restrict adoption by farmers."
463,"Invest in agricultural research and development","Forest based Livestock ",LAC,"Adaptation option","Government agencies, researchers and civil society need to collaborate and hold dialogue on drivers of deforestation and forest degradation addressing climate change impacts and land use types. Rigorous research is needed to understand the impacts of climate change on forest-based agricultural systems and when and why producers adopt sustainable practices."
464,"Capacity building on sustainable agricultural practices","Forest based Livestock ",LAC,"Adaptation option","Sustainable agricultural production in the Amazon region can be promoted by combining farmer training and education with technology and investment. Assistance in the form of technical education and access to financing for sustainable practices were identified as key to developing sustainable cattle supply chains."
465,"Improve networking and knowledge exchange","Forest based Livestock ",LAC,"Adaptation option","Multi-sectoral partnerships in agricultural-forest frontiers should be established for improved social and environmental governance.  Participatory processes involving government agents, civil society and rural communities should be undertaken to improve the resilience of the agricultural system by drawing upon local knowledge. Failure to foster synergies and cooperation between the diverse set of stakeholders may result in missed opportunities to achieve more equitable land and resource use systems."
466,"Policy reform","Forest based Livestock ",LAC,"Adaptation option","Policy can be developed or improved to encourage sustainable land use. This is best achieved through dialogue facilitated with multiple stakeholders (e.g. government agents, civil society, private sector and land users) and appropriate land use zoning and enforcement."

481,"Increasingly erratic rainfall","High Altitude Mixed (C. Andes)",LAC,"Hazard","Occurrence of unpredictable rainfall patterns is becoming more common for example there is a period where the precipitation is decreasing while events like the El nino bring about heavy rainfall causing floods.  Altered precipitation cycles characterized by more intense down- pours followed by longer droughts, loss of glaciers, degradation of key ecosystems, and the loss of critical ecosystem services (e.g., water supplies, water buffering, retention, regulation, and soil protection) will impact freshwater supplies regionally and poten- tially generate upstream-downstream tradeoffs and synergies. Scarce water resources for rainfed and irrigated crops"
482,"Rising sea levels","High Altitude Mixed (C. Andes)",LAC,"Hazard","Increased temperatures leads to Glaciers melting at an even faster rate. The tropical glaciers in the Central Andes in particular have lost major portions of their volume in the course of the 20th century. Regional studies show that the retreat has accelerated, with the strongest recession rates after 1985. Glacial lake outbursts and connected flooding present a hazard for Andean cities. The loss of glaciers will likely impact the páramos (Andean, high carbon stock moorlands) which are the source of water for many Andean cities."
483,"Increase in average temperatures","High Altitude Mixed (C. Andes)",LAC,"Hazard","Increase in average temperature have led tp reduced yields and increased incidence of diseases and pests. Forced migration to higher elevations, threatening endemic species Evidence shows that temperature extremes have already increased and are set to rise further.

584,"Increase in food insecurity","Irrigated",LAC,"Impact","Climate change is expected to have an adverse impact on agricultural production and food security in the irrigated drylands of Central and South America. For example, in Chile, drought is projected to have a significant impact on the production of fruit farmers. In Mexico, farmers highlighted drought as the main cause for agricultural losses, with Baja California, Sonora, and Sinaloa being badly affected. In Central-West Argentina, drought (2010/2011- 2014/2015) resulted in water shortages reducing grape and seasonal crop production as well as the loss of livestock, resulting in a decrease in regional food security."
585,"Loss of income","Irrigated",LAC,"Impact","Adverse climate change effects on agricultural productivity will cause a decline in the incomes of rural households."
586,"Increase in poverty","Irrigated",LAC,"Impact","Climate change can negatively impact upon agricultural productivity thereby enhancing rural poverty levels."

588,"Weak land tenure and access rights for women","Irrigated",LAC,"Vulnerability","In Central and South America, women engaged in agricultural activities are typically excluded from extension systems and denied access to benefits from climate de-risking, higher-profitability options and information, thereby limiting their ability to sustainably improve their agricultural activities. Land tenure systems also tend to be unequal, for example, 15% of agricultural units are owned by women in Central America, and 23% in South America. In Mexico, less than 33% of all landowners are women."
589,"Inadequate regulation of water resources","Irrigated",LAC,"Vulnerability","Poor water use regulation has led to an overexploitation of water resources in the irrigation agricultural system. For example, Chile’s hydrological regulation capacity lacks coordination between institutions and is challenged by data deficits."
590,"Unequal opportunities for women ","Irrigated",LAC,"Vulnerability","In Central and South America, women engaged in agricultural activities are typically excluded from extension systems and denied access to benefits from climate de-risking, higher-profitability options and information, thereby limiting their ability to sustainably improve their agricultural activities."
591,"Inadequate climate information services","Irrigated",LAC,"Vulnerability","There is a need for improved monitoring and information distribution on climate hazards and impacts affecting the irrigated agricultural system.  For example, there is a need for improved monitoring of snowfall and groundwater levels in Central-West Argentina. Improved hydrometeorological forecasts will enable farmers' to make informed decisions. "
592,"Weak land tenure ","Irrigated",LAC,"Vulnerability","In general, the Latin America and Caribbean region lacks regularisation of land tenure and access to land. Furthermore, weak policies promote environmentally irresponsible investments contributing to the deterioration of the region's natural resources affecting the productive base on which the agricultural sector depends. "
593,"Low access to credit","Irrigated",LAC,"Vulnerability","A lack of access to credit was highlighted as a key vulnerability in Mexico and Chile. For example, in Mexico, access to financial resources is a major challenge, with only 1.5% of financial products channelled to the rural sector."
594,"Water scarce area","Irrigated",LAC,"Vulnerability","The irrigated agricultural system is found in arid areas of Northern and Central Mexico and coastal and inland valley areas of Peru, Chile and Western Argentina. Water scarcity challenges affect over 49% of Mexico, with the northern region facing frequent droughts. In Chile, climate change is affecting water resources, both from the demand and supply side. The agricultural sector in Chile constitutes 82% of total consumptive water extraction at the national level and the country is currently classified as being in a state of “high” to “extremely high” water stress. The Peruvian coastline is the most arid region of the country."
595,"Limited uptake of modern technologies","Irrigated",LAC,"Vulnerability","There is a low level of adoption of improved irrigation technology. For example, in Central Chile, only 30% of farmers interviewed used new technologies and efficient irrigation systems."
596,"Poor water use efficiency and management","Irrigated",LAC,"Vulnerability","Water use efficiency is typically low in the irrigated agricultural system due to a low adoption of modern irrigation technology, a lack of maintenance of water storage and irrigation infrastructure and inefficient practices. For example, Mexico's National Water Plan (2019–2024) identifies inefficient water use as a key issue in the agricultural sector, which generates water losses of more than 40%."
597,"Unsustainable land management practices","Irrigated",LAC,"Vulnerability","Crop and livestock production are generally unsustainable and negatively impact natural resources. For example, unsustainable production has led to environmental challenges such as soil erosion and salinisation, overexploitation of aquifers, contamination of freshwater bodies and ecosystem damage. Unsustainable practices are the result of unclear land tenure rights, inefficient public policies, and a lack of knowledge of sustainable agricultural practices."
598,"High demand for irrigation water","Irrigated",LAC,"Vulnerability","Increasing aridity and agricultural expansion have increased the demand for irrigation water. For example, there is growing pressure on water resources for grape production in Mexico. In Peru, water demand is increasing to produce export goods with high water needs, such as asparagus, grapes, avocado and blueberries."
599,"Invest in water harvesting and storage infrastructure","Irrigated",LAC,"Adaptation option","There is a need to invest in rainwater harvesting and storage infrastructure to allow for irrigation when faced with water shortages. For example, in Mexico, farmers are using reservoirs and rainwater harvesting systems."
600,"Invest in agricultural research and development","Irrigated",LAC,"Adaptation option","In general, there is a need to invest in research on the impacts of climate change on the irrigated agricultural system. There is a lack of Latin American case studies on the impacts of drought on water quality and most importantly, its relation to irrigated agriculture. In Mexico, there has been a recent push for innovation, research, technology development, and education in the agricultural sector. However, research focusing on the sustainable use of water in agriculture is still in its infancy, but it is becoming a priority field."

606,"Improve networking and knowledge exchange","Irrigated",LAC,"Adaptation option","Collaboration between researchers and national water authorities is key to improving water management decision making. For example, groundwater modelling can inform extraction limits in irrigated agricultural systems to reduce future challenges surrounding overexploitation and water scarcity."
607,"Land tenure reform","Irrigated",LAC,"Adaptation option","Land tenure reform that addresses inequalities in ownership and resource access and encourages sustainable natural resource use is key to improving the productive base on which the region's agricultural sector depends. "
608,"Improve regulation of groundwater extraction","Irrigated",LAC,"Adaptation option","There is a need for improved regulation of groundwater extraction for irrigated agricultural production. For example, in Chile, regulations focused on surface water extraction, which lead to an overextraction of groundwater and significant reductions in groundwater levels. Groundwater regulation in Chile can be  improved by bettering horizontal and vertical inter-institutional coordination as well as strengthening the institutions themselves."
609,"Incentivise sustainable natural resource use","Irrigated",LAC,"Adaptation option","Economic incentive mechanisms can be used to improve water use efficiency in the irrigated agricultural system."

643,"Weak land tenure ","Maize-beans (Mesoamerica)",LAC,"Vulnerability","Smallholder farmers (particularly those from Honduras and Guatemala) have insecure land tenure and either rent the land that that they cultivate, use communal land, or share land with other farmers. Almost all surveyed smallholder farmers in Costa Rica owned the land they cultivated. Land tenure in El Salvador is weak, affecting the country's adaptive capacity. Most smallholder maize and bean farmers rent land from other farmers. El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua have weak land tenure schemes."
644,"Inadequate climate information services","Maize-beans (Mesoamerica)",LAC,"Vulnerability","Climate information products in Central America do not typically include recommendations on farm or ecosystem management. Information products tend to be generalised, excluding specific time horizons and do not include information on particular regions or crops.

645,"Low access to credit","Maize-beans (Mesoamerica)",LAC,"Vulnerability","Of 188 coffee farmers surveyed in Central America, 14.4% requested better access to finance. Farmers in El Salvador in particular, had low access to financial resources."
646,"Large contributor to national/regional GDP","Maize-beans (Mesoamerica)",LAC,"Vulnerability","Much of the regional economy is based on agriculture. In Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua, more than two thirds of the population depends on agriculture. Sixty percent of Honduras’ gross domestic product is agricultural, with coffee, maize and beans being the main crops."
647,"High levels of deforestation","Maize-beans (Mesoamerica)",LAC,"Vulnerability","Forest areas in Guatemala and Honduras steadily decreased between 1990 and 2015. The main reason for the decrease (especially in Honduras) is deforestation due to agricultural expansion. Nicaragua has lost half of its forest cover in the last half-century."

673,"Implement agroforestry practices","Maize-beans (Mesoamerica)",LAC,"Adaptation option","Planting of trees was one of the most commonly mentioned climate change adaptation options by smallholder farmers surveyed in Central America. Agroforestry (shade trees) is a common adaptation method for smallholder coffee farmers in Central America."
674,"Diversify to livestock value chains","Maize-beans (Mesoamerica)",LAC,"Adaptation option","A key farm-level adaptation strategy involves the diversification of agriculture to increase food and income sources. For example, aqua-agro-silvo-pastoral systems can produce a wide range of products for local consumption as well as for market. This creates alternative livelihoods, which diminish household vulnerability to lower maize and bean production. Furthermore, improved integration of crops and animals can enhance nutrient cycling resulting in higher crop yields, better soil and water quality and increased biodiversity together with lower greenhouse gas emissions and increased carbon sequestration."
675,"Diversify livelihoods","Maize-beans (Mesoamerica)",LAC,"Adaptation option","Income diversification in rural areas is essential for lowering the vulnerability of rural communities, reducing migration and improving the quality of life of smallholder producers. However, the accessibility of alternative livelihood options to smallholder farmers varies from country to country. "
676,"Implement conservation agriculture practices","Maize-beans (Mesoamerica)",LAC,"Adaptation option","Improved soil management is critical to enhance crop resilience and minimise yield reductions under increased water stress. Soil and water conservation practices are key to soil moisture retention. Grain farmers in Honduras, Guatemala and Costa Rica adopted soil and water conservation practices as a means of climate change adaptation, incorporating practices such as mulching to retain soil moisture and prevent erosion. "
677,"Apply integrated pest and diseases management","Maize-beans (Mesoamerica)",LAC,"Adaptation option","Integrated pest and disease management plans can reduce yield losses. In Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, optimised pest and disease control resulted in an average maize yield increase of 16% across all sites, but did not significantly improve bean yields overall."

685,"Build climate information services","Maize-beans (Mesoamerica)",LAC,"Adaptation option","Systems to capture and disseminate agro-climatic information need to be strengthened in Central America. Accurate, tailored and timely data is key for research, adaptation, decision making and policy design. "
686,"Improve access to agricultural extension services","Maize-beans (Mesoamerica)",LAC,"Adaptation option","Strengthening of extension services is key for providing technical support to farmers on how to enhance their resilience to climate change. The strategies and practices of existing agricultural extension services should be reassessed. Strengthening the adaptive capacity of the most vulnerable groups should be prioritised but done in such a way as to encourage communities to generate their own solutions. Farmers in Central America identified the need for government support in providing agricultural inputs, technical support and training."
687,"Improve access to credit","Maize-beans (Mesoamerica)",LAC,"Adaptation option","Policies that allow maize and bean and coffee farmers to access credit and other financing mechanisms are critical for climate change adaptation as well as for enabling the farmers to escape the poverty trap."
688,"Establish payment for ecosystem services schemes","Maize-beans (Mesoamerica)",LAC,"Adaptation option","The establishment of payment for ecosystem services schemes can be used to incentivise smallholder farmers to better manage their land and to modify their practices to maintain or enhance specific ecosystem services. This adaptation option is viable in areas with adequate land tenure policy."
689,"Improve access to input/output markets","Maize-beans (Mesoamerica)",LAC,"Adaptation option","Farmers in Central America identified the need for government support in providing agricultural inputs, technical support and training, indicating that these factors serve as constraints to farmer adaptation."

The region is not self-sufficient in food production and relies mainly on imports: about 50% of its wheat and barley, 40% of its rice and 70% of its maize"
787,"Increase in migration","Highland Mixed",MENA,"Impact","There has been substantial levels of migration to urban and plains areas and even more households are likely to abandon farming and move to areas with better economic opportunities and services."
788,"Lack of willingness to invest in sustainable agricultural practices","Highland Mixed",MENA,"Impact","Most of the farmers in the agrisystem are mainly small scale subsistence farmers and they generally lack the willingness to invest in sustainable agricultural practices due to lack of financial capabilities to invest in proper farm inputs and infrastructure."
789,"Loss of income","Highland Mixed",MENA,"Impact","Loss of livelihood and income to to extreme events such as floods and droughts impacts on the communities heavily due to damage of infrastrucuture and agricultural produce."

799,"Increase in post-harvest losses","Highland Mixed",MENA,"Impact",
800,"Unsustainable natural resource use","Highland Mixed",MENA,"Vulnerability","There has been a decline in the quality of the natural resource base due to unsustainalbe practices such as inadequate maintenance of terraces in recent years. To some extent, this neglect of terrace maintenance has been caused by reduced labour availability, as a result of substantial levels of emigration to urban and plains areas"
801,"High poverty levels ","Highland Mixed",MENA,"Vulnerability","Currently, farmers in this farming system are amongst the poorest and most marginalised in the region. They are disconnected from resources, markets, extension services and social protection systems, making them even more vulnerable to the impacts of climate change."
802,"Demographic pressure on land","Highland Mixed",MENA,"Vulnerability","An additional strain on food and water demand is exerted by a strong population growth (almost 2% per year – about twice the world average), which is expected to double by 2050. In addition to rising population, higher living standards, urbanization and further development in general will all exercise an increasing pressure on the already scarce resources, in turn deeply interwoven with food-security challenges"

807,"Poor water use efficiency and management","Highland Mixed",MENA,"Vulnerability",
808,"Weak land tenure ","Highland Mixed",MENA,"Vulnerability","One of the policy challenges in the highland mixed farming system is how to improve labour productivity, given the current land use and land tenure regimes. The current fragmented land use system, where about 50 per cent of the farms in the highland mixed system are smaller than 1.5 ha, is a disincentive for agricultural mechanization and commercial farming. The land tenure policies of the governments, along with weak institutions, are often blamed for poor agricultural performance"
809,"Conflict prone area","Highland Mixed",MENA,"Vulnerability","MENA has a high degree of political instability and a low level of economic freedom. In addition, it has suffered from war (invasion or civil violence) for decades. The instabilitiy impacts on the livelihood of the communities."
810,"Weak land tenure and access rights for women","Highland Mixed",MENA,"Vulnerability",
811,"Low access to markets","Highland Mixed",MENA,"Vulnerability","The sustainability of this farming system depends in part on economic profitability that must provide for reinvestment in the maintenance of the ecosystem services and in satisfying the livelihoods of the people. Although small-scale farmers in the highland mixed system are keen to intensify and diversify, they are currently constrained by limited access to input and output markets. The challenging terrain and associated high cost of infrastructure development have been disincentives to develop roads and marketing in the respective countries to allow inputs and agricultural producers to move efficiently and economically"
812,"Low access to credit","Highland Mixed",MENA,"Vulnerability","The risk inherent in smallholder farming, bad loans, inefficiencies in the banking sector, and lack of security exclude many farmers from formal credit. Governments tend to see credit policy in terms of capping the interest rate, which benefits farmers who can get credit already but discourages banks from lending to poorer clients."
813,"Barriers to trade","Highland Mixed",MENA,"Vulnerability",
814,"Unstable commodity prices","Highland Mixed",MENA,"Vulnerability",
815,"High prevalence of land degradation","Highland Mixed",MENA,"Vulnerability","The location of the farming system on undulating and mountainous landscapes (with slopes ranging from 5 to 35 per cent), along with high rainfall intensity and recurrent deforestation, makes it susceptible to erosion. Erosion is the major environmental factor aggravating soil fertility decline, decreasing productivity, reducing soil carbon stock and diminishing environmental services. A quarter of the highlands of Ethiopia are seriously eroded"
816,"Unfavourable soil conditions","Highland Mixed",MENA,"Vulnerability","Unfavourable soil conditions is a vulnerability that has been caused by years of soil erosion due to climatic hazards."
817,"Water scarce area","Highland Mixed",MENA,"Vulnerability","Countries under the farming system are some of the most water scarce countries in the world and this is further exacerbated by droughts, increasing populations and little water conservation efforts."
818,"Predominantly small-scale subsistence farming","Highland Mixed",MENA,"Vulnerability","Nearly 85 percent of agricultural land holdings in the MENA region are farmed by small-scale farmers characterized by small land holdings and limited resources for farm inputs."
819,"Low access to markets","Highland Mixed",MENA,"Vulnerability","The system is constrained by limited human and financial capital, and poor market access with at least 7.1 hrs travel to reach the nearest town with 50,000 people"
820,"Low access to agricultural extension services","Highland Mixed",MENA,"Vulnerability","Farmers in the farming system are among the various agricultural communities who are  disproportionately impacted by climate change. This is partly due to their direct dependence on natural resources and detachment from the extension services and social protection systems that could enable them to build their capacity and resilience."
821,"Lack of irrigation infrastructure ","Highland Mixed",MENA,"Vulnerability","There is some limited irrigation that is used for the cultivation of horticultural and field crops."
822,"High illiteracy rates ","Highland Mixed",MENA,"Vulnerability","Traditional” farmers tend to be among the least educated and oldest segments of the population. MENA governments need to invest in rural education and professional training, both formal and informal, to help them adjust to the managerial and technological complexities of producing for the modern urban market and to help other family members to access better off-farm income, or to be better equipped to migrate to cities. "

826,"Invest in road infrastructure","Highland Mixed",MENA,"Adaptation option","There is a poor but expanding road network in the farming system. In Ethiopia for instance, the road density grew more than 70 per cent between 1997 and 2009, and the average distance to an all-weather road decreased from 21.4 km to 11.8 km. Nevertheless, the vast majority of the highland communities are yet to be connected."
827,"Invest in water harvesting and storage infrastructure","Highland Mixed",MENA,"Adaptation option","Several countries under the agrisystem are imlemeting water harvesting and storage such as Egypt  which is constructing 633 water storage facilities, with a capacity of 266.34 million m3. It explained that 160 dams, 307 artificial lakes, and 39 protection bridges, 93 barriers and artificial canals have been implemented, as well as the repairing and construction of 34 flood waterholes"
828,"Implement efficient water management","Highland Mixed",MENA,"Adaptation option","There are various water management strategies that are being implemented for example the Participatory Watershed Management and Poverty Reduction approach in Tunisia."
829,"Diversify livelihoods","Highland Mixed",MENA,"Adaptation option","Remittances from off-farm work are a major source of income (about half of males work outside their district), which is supplemented by traditional income sources such as almonds, walnuts, carob pods and aromatic plants."
830,"Adopt drought tolerant varieties","Highland Mixed",MENA,"Adaptation option","In both the north and west of the country, most small-scale farmers also keep livestock, mostly sheep. Sheep are the least affected livestock group, and this is especially the case in mixed farming systems such as those in Iran. Maintaining sheep populations and breeding drought and heat tolerate sheep could be an effective livelihood adaptation strategy for these farmers"
831,"Capacity building on sustainable agricultural practices","Highland Mixed",MENA,"Adaptation option","Aggressive sustainable land management government programs, including construction of terraces and water harvesting structures, rehabilitation exclosures of degraded landscapes as well as watershed management schemes have been implemented"
832,"Improve networking and knowledge exchange","Highland Mixed",MENA,"Adaptation option","Improving agricultural growth and productivity demands the development and promotion of an environment that encourages knowledge to be produced, communicated and applied to a nation’s needs (Joint Science Academies statement 2006). The current weak institutional capacity, sectoral policies and fragmented institutional arrangements need to be amended to facilitate knowledge flow and improve communication"
833,"Establish farmer organisations","Highland Mixed",MENA,"Adaptation option","Farmer organizations play a vital role in helping farmers gain access to the resources necessary to increase yields and increase income. This ultimately supports their shift from subsistence farming to farming as a business. An example is  Nuru Ethiopia-supported farmer organizations which are led and owned by the local community members. Local ownership and leadership allow for the important knowledge that farmers gain through their respective farmer organizations to be continuously recycled back into the organization and the local community. This continuous improvement allows farmer organizations to adapt to new challenges. "
834,"Build capacity on advocacy","Highland Mixed",MENA,"Adaptation option",
835,"Policy reform","Highland Mixed",MENA,"Adaptation option","Public policies and programmes have played an extremely important role in shaping market conditions and private sector investment"
836,"Develop policies for building climate change resilience","Highland Mixed",MENA,"Adaptation option","A few MENA countries have prepared themselves against natural and man-made disasters. The example countries are Egypt, Algeria, Morocco and Lebanon. These countries have composed specific policies, in addition to setting up intra-governmental risk management units, to decrease their extent of vulnerability. The established units are meant to assess risk by taking advantage from early warning systems, knowledge centers and risk management laboratories "
837,"Invest in agricultural research and development","Highland Mixed",MENA,"Adaptation option",
838,"Improve access to markets","Highland Mixed",MENA,"Adaptation option","Domestic markets in the region are generally tightly integrated into global agricultural markets and this interdependence is certain to continue and expected to deepen for products such as wheat and maize."
839,"Diversify markets","Highland Mixed",MENA,"Adaptation option","Specific mountain products and services including mountain tourism, medicinals, highland fruits, flowers, honey and other organic food items are in increasing global demand (ICIMOD 2011). Highland farmers could effectively compete in national and international markets if they are able to exploit their distinct agroecology and traditions by producing superior quality products with certified food origins that meet sanitary requirements and other policies of niche markets."
840,"Support local value chains","Highland Mixed",MENA,"Adaptation option","MENA governments have subsidised wheat production for many years using three main policy interventions: guaranteed prices, input subsidies, and import tariffs. The purpose of these policies is to raise the price and lower the costs for domestic production of wheat in order to increase self- sufficiency in wheat production. In Iraq, for example, the Ministry of Trade supports wheat producers through a guaranteed price for no. 1 wheat that exceeds the import price of wheat."
841,"Improve access to credit","Highland Mixed",MENA,"Adaptation option",
842,"Area of land used","Highland Mixed",MENA,"Exposure","The highland mixed farming system falls under the Semiarid - subhumid agroecological zone covering an area of 74 million ha."

844,"Risk to farmers of chronic poverty due to Climate Change ","Highland Mixed",MENA,"Risk","Around 43 percent of the MENA region’s population live in rural areas, which in turn are highly affected by the poverty that results from exclusion from the region’s economic growth; 70 percent of the region’s poor currently live in rural areas and are largely dependent on agriculture for their livelihoods. There is a higher prevalence of rural poverty in the highland mixed farming system and household economies. Of these, small-scale farmers with limited access to irrigation sources and net food buyers are amongst the poorest in the region."
845,"Risk to farmers of food insecurity due to Climate Change","Highland Mixed",MENA,"Risk","While it is important to understand the impacts of climate change on small-scale farmers to ensure they can transition out of poverty and hunger, there are also broader implications for the food security of those living in the region. With around 40 percent of the region’s overall food supply coming from imports, this region is highly dependent on international markets and is susceptible to the price fluctuations that are likely to arise as agricultural production globally becomes less predictable"
846,"Risk to farmers of loss of livelihoods due to Climate Change ","Highland Mixed",MENA,"Risk","Income and employment may be lost as a result of more frequent droughts in rural areas, and to floods and sea surges in urban and coastal areas. Changes in temperature and precipitation patterns may result in damage to strategic economic sectors such as tourism or others with growth potential such as high-value-added agriculture"
847,"Increase in average temperatures","Rainfed Mixed",MENA,"Hazard","The MENA Region including countries with the rainfed mixed agrisystem, is one of the World’s most exposed regions to negative climate change impacts.  Heat extremes and water shortages are quite prevalent. With 4°C global warming the mean summer temperatures can increase by up to 8°C, water runoff could decrease by 75%, and land aridity could increase in many parts of the region by more than 60%. In particular vulnerable to negative climate change impacts is the rain fed agricultural production and livelihoods of poor farmers."
848,"Increase in drought events","Rainfed Mixed",MENA,"Hazard","Drought is the most prevalent climate hazard in the agrisystem its impacts on livelihoods are severe and cause the highest human losses. Its effects include decreased water supplies, as well as loss of harvest and livestock. which, in turn, threaten food security and often cause widespread malnutrition."
849,"Increase in tropical cyclones/hurricanes","Rainfed Mixed",MENA,"Hazard","Heavy flood conditions also often follow tropical cyclones events, which are widespread in the vicinity of the Indian Ocean and Arabian Sea, and can have long-lasting impacts on coastal settlements and natural systems. "
850,"Rising sea levels","Rainfed Mixed",MENA,"Hazard","Countries in the region within the agrisystem are also particularly vulnerable to sea level rise due to climate change. About seven percent of the total population in MENA countries lives in areas where elevation is less than five metres above sea level and a large share of economic activities especially agriculture and population is concentrated in coastal areas which are exposed to increasing risks of flooding, inundation, land erosion and salinization. The effect of sea level rise could be extremely disruptive for climate-sensitive activities especially agriculture and fishing."
851,"Shorter growing season","Rainfed Mixed",MENA,"Hazard","The agrisystem is impacted by low rainfal period and higher temperatures which leads to shorter growing periods especially for the wheat value chain commodity."
852,"Increase in extreme heat (no. of hot days)","Rainfed Mixed",MENA,"Hazard","The most immediate threat posed by climate change to the agrisystem, one that is in the forefront of climate adaptation efforts, is extreme heat. In extreme heat-prone regions such as the rainfed mixed farming system and the coastal communities  excessive temperatures that could push well into the 50-60°C range, coupled with humidity and sea level rise, the cumulative effect can be devastating to infrastructure and human populations. Extreme heat has direct implications for three important aspects of society that are relevant in the context of the farming system: public health, safety, and development."
853,"Decrease in average precipitation","Rainfed Mixed",MENA,"Hazard","The observational record for most countries in the North Africa and the Middle East where the farming system occurs, indicates an overall reduction in extreme precipitation events since the 1960s, despite a local positive trend over the Atlas mountains since the 1980s."
854,"Increase in extreme rainfall events","Rainfed Mixed",MENA,"Hazard","Extreme rainfall events recorded in the agrisystem have lead to flooding events which causes destrcution of infrastructure and agricultural produce in the farms."
855,"Increasingly erratic rainfall","Rainfed Mixed",MENA,"Hazard",
856,"Soil erosion","Rainfed Mixed",MENA,"Impact","The rainfed farming system agricultural area is impacted by  soil erosion especially during rainstorms and erosion by wind on light, over-cultivated, exposed soils."
857,"Change in production zone suitability","Rainfed Mixed",MENA,"Impact","Warmer and drier climate is projected to shift vegetation and agricultural zones northwards, e.g., by 75 km for 2090–2099 relative to 2000–2009 in a 4°C world (Evans, 2009). Ferrise et al. (2013) also projected a shift northward for olive plantations."
858,"Shorter growing seasons","Rainfed Mixed",MENA,"Impact","Lower rainfalls and higher temperatures will shorten growing periods for wheat in the farming system region by about two weeks by mid-century (2031-2050). The wheat growing period in Tunisia is expected to be shortened by 10 days for 1.3°C, by 16 days for 2°C, by 20 days for 2.5°C and by 30 days for 4°C warming."
859,"Reduced crop productivity/failure","Rainfed Mixed",MENA,"Impact","Most agricultural activities in the MENA region take place in the semi-arid climate zone, either close to the coast or in the highlands. Crop yields are expected to decline by 30 percent with 1.5-2°C warming without considering adaptation."
860,"Reduced livestock productivity","Rainfed Mixed",MENA,"Impact","Climate change impacts on livestock production through various pathways, such as, changes in the quantity and quality of available feeds, changes in the length of the grazing season, additional heat stress, reduced drinking water, and changes in livestock diseases and disease vectors. The vulnerability of livestock production systems to droughts was recently demonstrated in north-eastern Syria, where herders lost almost 85 percent of their livestock as a result of the recurring droughts between 2005 and 2010."
861,"Reduced groundwater tables","Rainfed Mixed",MENA,"Impact","Ground water is the major source of water in the agrisystem and there is a substaincial reduction in ground water levels due to a combination of precipitation scarcity, high population growth and geographic concentration of the population. This is the most water-stressed area in the world."
862,"Desertification","Rainfed Mixed",MENA,"Impact","Climatic variations and human activities are the main driving factors of desertification in areas of the farming system. Deforestation for extensive agricultural activities in the vulnerable ecosystems of arid and semi-arid areas, which are thus strained beyond their capacity, coupled with increase in temperatures and reduced precipitation causes desertification"
863,"Land degradation","Rainfed Mixed",MENA,"Impact","Poor farming practices, iland pollution and extreme weather particularly drought leads to land degradation. "

875,"Increase in migration","Rainfed Mixed",MENA,"Impact","As a consequence of worsening extreme heat, drought and aridity conditions under climate change, deteriorating rural livelihoods associated with declining agricultural productivity will continue to contribute to migration flows, often to urban areas as already observed"
876,"Competition for resources","Rainfed Mixed",MENA,"Impact","The region could be heavily challenged by both rising food and water demand given its projected increase in population that may double by 2070. As a result, the regions already substantial import dependency could increase and thus its vulnerability to agricultural impacts well beyond its country borders."
877,"Conflict over resources","Rainfed Mixed",MENA,"Impact","A severe and sustained pressure on resources could contribute to further social unrest in the already unstable political environment that currently characterizes parts of the region."
878,"Increase in food insecurity","Rainfed Mixed",MENA,"Impact","Farmers in the agrisystem have traditionally coped with harsh climatic conditions, and climate change adds to the existing challenges. Most agricultural activities take place in the semiarid climate zones close to the coast or in the highlands, where rainfall and thus water availability are predicted to decline most strongly. Therefore, climate change impacts have important implications for farmers’ livelihoods, national economies, food security and poverty ."
879,"Increase in food imports","Rainfed Mixed",MENA,"Impact","The major impact of water scacity prevailing in the areas of the farming system prevents  countries from producing all required food domestically and makes the region dependent on food imports."
880,"Increase in food prices","Rainfed Mixed",MENA,"Impact","Increase in food importation due to poor poor productivity leads to increased foor prices. "
881,"Increase in women's workload","Rainfed Mixed",MENA,"Impact","The region is facing unequal opportunities for women hence leading to increase in women workload."

884,"Demographic pressure on land","Rainfed Mixed",MENA,"Vulnerability","A principal trend and issue concern the poor access to quality land faced by increasing numbers of small scale farmers."
885,"Unequal opportunities for women ","Rainfed Mixed",MENA,"Vulnerability","Women are becoming increasingly marginalised in the production process and their labour is being progressively displaced, as men dominate the mechanisation processes for all the main crops."
886,"High poverty levels ","Rainfed Mixed",MENA,"Vulnerability","High poverty levels especially among the rural farmers is high due to the problem of water scarcity that impacts on agriculture which is their main source of livelihood. Poverty also affects the ability of the farmers to cope with climate change."
887,"Poor water use efficiency and management","Rainfed Mixed",MENA,"Vulnerability","Despite its extreme water scarcity, countries within the agrisystem and the MENA region consume more water per capita than the global average, with Arab residential water and energy markets among the most heavily subsidized in the world. Reevaluation and redesigning of irrigation, and water-harvesting practices to sustain a healthy agricultural sector must be improved where economically viable. "
888,"Unsustainable natural resource use","Rainfed Mixed",MENA,"Vulnerability","The renewable natural resources on which smallholder farmers depend are increasingly being degraded, posing significant risks to natural resources. "
889,"Inconsistencies in policy implementation","Rainfed Mixed",MENA,"Vulnerability","There appears to be little commitment by many governments to supporting the sector - particularly the smaller farmers - through regulation of imports and specific support to poor farmers."
890,"Conflict prone area","Rainfed Mixed",MENA,"Vulnerability","Social unrest and political instability is a characteristic of many part of the MENA region and this coupled with climate change impacts heavily on agricultural production."
891,"Unstable commodity prices","Rainfed Mixed",MENA,"Vulnerability","Water and land constraints in the agrisystem impacts on agricultural productivity forcing countries within the system to rely on imports making them also vulnerable to price shocks on the global markets and harvest failures in other world regions."
892,"Low access to markets","Rainfed Mixed",MENA,"Vulnerability","Low access to market is caused by heavy importation of food commodities due to low agricultural productivity. Increasing and diversifying exports of goods and services will allow countries in the agrisystem to accumulate foreign reserves, which allows for importing additional food in times of droughts and other crises."
893,"High prevalence of land degradation","Rainfed Mixed",MENA,"Vulnerability","Land degradation is prevalent within the farming system due to increasing demographic pressure coupled with extreme climatic hazards such as droughts and floods that impact on existing natural resources."
894,"Water scarce area","Rainfed Mixed",MENA,"Vulnerability","Countries within the farming system are some of the most water stressed countries in the world. High temperatures and low precipitation  is likely to result in further increased pressures on water resources and agriculture."
895,"High levels of deforestation","Rainfed Mixed",MENA,"Vulnerability","Mismanagement of natural resources allowing for heavy deforestation rates and forest fires for example in Syria further exacerbates the impacts of climate change and hinders mitigation strategies"
896,"High poverty levels ","Rainfed Mixed",MENA,"Vulnerability","The prevalence of poverty is extensive among farmers in the system because of poor infrastructure, the degradation of natural resources, low rainfall and weak market linkages. Poverty also largely results from lack of access to resources, including inequitable sharing of water, food, and energy resources. Land management practices are often inefficient and many policies favor urban populations and the supply of cheap food instead of supporting rural development. Addressing these factors could considerably reduce the risk of climate change contributing to increased poverty."
897,"Reliance on rainfed agriculture","Rainfed Mixed",MENA,"Vulnerability","Seventy percent of the region’s agriculture production is on rain-fed land. Taking into account that most of the land area receives less than 300 mm of annual rainfall and that the lower limit for rain-fed agriculture is between 200 and 300 mm annual rainfall, the agrisystem is highly vulnerable to temperature and precipitation changes, with associated consequences for food security and rural livelihoods."
898,"Lack of irrigation infrastructure ","Rainfed Mixed",MENA,"Vulnerability","Reevaluation and redesigning of irrigation, and water-harvesting practices to sustain a healthy agricultural sector must be improved where economically viable to get “more crop per drop”. Irrigated crops are less affected by droughts; however, expanding irrigation is possible only to a limited extent, especially in Syria and all other countries in the MENA region, which have severely constrained water resources."
899,"Inadequate agri research and development","Rainfed Mixed",MENA,"Vulnerability","Agricultural sector in the region is vulnerable to inadequate agricultural research and development due to poor organisation of resources and lack of entrepreneurship. "
900,"Dependent on a single crop type","Rainfed Mixed",MENA,"Vulnerability",
901,"Implement reforestation practices","Rainfed Mixed",MENA,"Adaptation option","Reforestation projects in the countries within the agrisystem are an inexpensive and effective way of reducing air pollution, lowering temperatures by producing shade, improving health, and even raising property values. The return on investment (ROI) for tree planting is often more financially beneficial than other more costly investments, but ROI projections fluctuate when measuring effects in different areas."
902,"Invest in irrigation infrastructure","Rainfed Mixed",MENA,"Adaptation option","The most important change leading to better water management is improving water efficiency in agricultural irrigation. Traditional water management techniques have an important role in many Middle East and North African (MENA) countries under the rainfed mixed farming system. Due to their efficiency, revitalized traditional techniques for irrigation management of scarce water resources have been suggested as a way to at least partially cope with the present water crises"
903,"Invest in water harvesting and storage infrastructure","Rainfed Mixed",MENA,"Adaptation option","The region has coped with its water scarcity through a variety of means: abstraction of groundwater, water harvesting and storage, wastewater reuse."
904,"Diversify livelihoods","Rainfed Mixed",MENA,"Adaptation option","There are increasing attempts by farmers in the agrisystem to diversify crops in oorder to access a wider market and also involvement of individuals in substantial off-farm income generating activities, mostly from seasonal employment in the city."
905,"Invest in agricultural research and development","Rainfed Mixed",MENA,"Adaptation option","Land reform programmes should be continued and with the active participation of small farmer groups, continuing research is needed on systems of land and water management including traditional techniques used in the region. More adaptive, systemic research is required, both agricultural and socio-economic, on crop-livestock integration and risk reduction, and the stability and sustainability of farming systems."
906,"Implement efficient water management","Rainfed Mixed",MENA,"Adaptation option","In combination with other important water management actions, there is a need to identify economic incentives for improved water resource management and to develop communally based initiatives for the long-term management of water catchments - including the rehabilitation of terrace systems and the reintroduction of intercropping systems. Water scarcity is being addressed through a variety of means: abstraction of groundwater, water harvesting and storage, wastewater reuse, desalinization plants, and food imports. "
907,"Build women's  capacity ","Rainfed Mixed",MENA,"Adaptation option","The success of adaptation measures such as efficient water management and land reforms will depend to a large extent upon strengthening the role of women in active partivipation fro example watershed resource management and restoration."
908,"Adopt post-harvest technologies","Rainfed Mixed",MENA,"Adaptation option","Connected with the need to diversify markets and improve livelioods, there is a place for the development of simple processing methods, direct marketing by producers, and storage facilities at strategic points to preserve and improve the quality of produce."
909,"Implement conservation agriculture practices","Rainfed Mixed",MENA,"Adaptation option","Adoption of conservation agriculture (CA) in the rainfed farming is an emerging dimension for recycling biomass into soil system and improving SOC stock in the surface layer"
910,"Build women's  capacity ","Rainfed Mixed",MENA,"Adaptation option","If rural women taking on new roles (due to migration of men to look for income) do not have the skills to generate productive livelihoods, as a result of discriminatory social norms and limited education opportunities, then they are at risk of falling into poverty. Promoting gender equity, by tackling both discriminatory norms and inequalities in access to resources, is thus a vital component of effective climate-change adaptation strategies"
911,"Adopt drought tolerant varieties","Rainfed Mixed",MENA,"Adaptation option","Scientific advancement in breeding more drought-resistant varieties will be crucial in the future of rainfed agriculture in the countries under the farming system. Investing in the development of drought-resistant seeds and encouraging farmers to adopt these seeds may mitigate adverse consequences on rainfed agriculture and safeguard farmers from drought-induced yield losses"
912,"Capacity building on sustainable agricultural practices","Rainfed Mixed",MENA,"Adaptation option",
913,"Improve networking and knowledge exchange","Rainfed Mixed",MENA,"Adaptation option","Networking and knowledge exchange platforms can be enhanced at the community level to bring farmers together through extension services. Multistakeholder platfoms also known as innovation platforms or learning alliancess can be effective in networking and knowledge exchange by bringing together multiple stakeholders in the different sectors involved."
914,"Build capacity on advocacy","Rainfed Mixed",MENA,"Adaptation option","capacity building on advocacy is crucial for example  through awareness among citizens on their rights and responsibilities related to water, illegal water connections and tampering with meter readings."
915,"Policy reform","Rainfed Mixed",MENA,"Adaptation option","Policies are required to control a range of actions and practices with major negative environmental impacts; these include frequent, deep ploughing, excessive use of pesticides and excessive water extraction for irrigation. Improved natural resource management, enterprise diversification and off-farm income opportunities should also be promoted."
916,"Develop policies for building climate change resilience","Rainfed Mixed",MENA,"Adaptation option","Policies around food systems, water security and resilient natural capital is an effective climate-smart approach to agriculture and natural resource management in the countries within the agrisystem and is also instrumental to achieve food security and preserve biodiversity, while ensuring peace and stability.​"
917,"Develop/improve early warning systems","Rainfed Mixed",MENA,"Adaptation option",
918,"Target niche markets","Rainfed Mixed",MENA,"Adaptation option","There would appear to be a place for the development of niche (e.g. ethnic) and organic food production for international markets, e.g. olives, vines, pistachio, fruits, raisins, dates, spices, herbs and vegetables. Assistance with market entry is needed for small farmer groups."
919,"Farmers engaged in agri system","Rainfed Mixed",MENA,"Exposure","Many farms are intensively capitalised with a high level of inputs, and farmers are very sensitive to market opportunities. There are a number of specialised dairy and poultry enterprises within the system. In the drier areas, cereals become more dominant and there is often a greater interdependence among farming families who frequently share resources and equipment. Farm systems are diversified and there is a seasonal interaction with livestock (mainly sheep and goat) owners in the use of crop residues and other fodder. "

1118,"Unsustainable land management practices","Rice",SA,"Vulnerability","The rice-based cropping system is low yielding and nutrient exhaustive leading to poor soil fertility. Tillage intensive rice cropping practices have deteriorated the physical quality of soils and decreased soil organic carbon levels. Long-term wet tillage affects soil aggregation and microorganism activity, requires more water and emits substantial amounts of methane. The use of agro-chemicals has resulted in a growth in rice production but at the cost of soil health. This is exacerbated by a lack of crop diversification. "

For example, in Bangladesh, less than half (45%) of rice farmers have access to credit facilities."
1122,"Lack of access to risk insurance","Rice",SA,"Vulnerability","In South Asia, the agricultural insurance market is underdeveloped. Barriers to accessing insurance include a lack of awareness, a lack of legal and regulatory frameworks, a lack of financial capability of the providers, a limited range of agricultural product, a lack of technical expertise, the high cost of insurance products and low levels of affordability by farmers."
1123,"Water scarce area","Rice",SA,"Vulnerability","In South Asia, temperature increases of 1.5–2 °C could severely impact the availability of water resources due to increased monsoon variability. Water scarcity in agriculture is expected to worsen, exacerbated by increasing competition with other sectors. Furthermore, an increase in groundwater extraction to meet growing food demands is leading to a depletion of groundwater tables.
