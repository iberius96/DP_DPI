1,"Lowland Rice",EAP,"Increase in drought events","Leads to","Soil salinisation","Severe drought years such as 1977–1978, 1997–1998, 2015–2016 and 2019–2020 are all related to El Niño events, which greatly affect production. During low river flow periods in Mekong Delta, between March and April, saline water intrudes up to 40–50 km inland from estuaries through main river systems  and about 100,000 ha of rice annually is at high risk of dry-season salinity intrusion."
2,"Lowland Rice",EAP,"Rising sea levels","Leads to","Soil salinisation","The risks of increasing saline intrusion and permanent inundation due to sea level rise, will significantly reduce the land suitable for rice cultivation in the Mekong delta by 50 % by 2050"
3,"Lowland Rice",EAP,"Increase in average precipitation","Leads to","Increased flooding
","Seasonal river flooding, which coincides with the rainy season that runs from May to November, plays a critical role in the health of the Mekong river system. These floods deposit sediments, which improve soil fertility, flush out polluted waters, and recharge the groundwater tables. However, excessive flooding during the rainy season are becoming more frequent, and structural elements are not expected to hold up under an increasingly severe climate regime, which is driving sea-level rise (SLR) and changing meteorological and hydrological conditions.Changes in climate are also causing flooding and drought in Lao PDR"
4,"Lowland Rice",EAP,"Increase in average precipitation","Leads to","Siltation/sedimentation of rivers","Floods deposit sediments downstream in the rice fields. The floods  improve soil fertility, flush out polluted waters, and recharge the groundwater tables."
5,"Lowland Rice",EAP,"Decrease in average precipitation","Leads to","Reduced crop productivity/failure","Rainfall is greatly reduced in the Mekong and Red River deltas in the dry season. The annual rainy season tends to start late and to end early, resulting in a decrease in rainfall and runoff.  Reduced rainfall causes thousands of hectares of rice in the spring crop to suffer from drought or from reduction in irrigation water every year."
6,"Lowland Rice",EAP,"Decrease in average precipitation","Leads to","Water scarcity","The Mekong Delta is identified as water-risk “hotspots” that require a targeted policy response. These water risks are not only the result of precipitation changes but involve a range of factors, including farming practices, that cause water shortages, floods and degradation of water quality, extensive dam-building and ground water pumping."
7,"Lowland Rice",EAP,"Rising sea levels","Leads to","Reduced crop productivity/failure","A rise in the sea level of only 30 cm could see the loss of nearly 200,000hectares of rice cultivation. Vast tracks of land planted with rice are affected by salinity intrusion  causing reduved yield by  50-100%, or total loss. Sea level rise has adverse effect on the agricultural productivity especially in the deltas."
8,"Lowland Rice",EAP,"Rising sea levels","Leads to","Change in production zone suitability","Weather extremes, flood patterns, and saline intrusion will change in all agro-ecological zones, but the changes vary from North to South, and from
coastal to inland areas, affecting the habitat suitability of rice and other major crops. Thiscould have drastic effects on crop distribution
in the future. The mainthreats for rice cultivation in the Deltas are relative sea level rise and increased saline intrusions."
9,"Lowland Rice",EAP,"Increase in drought events","Leads to","Reduced groundwater tables","An increase in drought events leads to a reduction in annual surface runoff causing a  decrease in ground and surface water with a negative effect on agriculture and water supply for industrial use."
10,"Lowland Rice",EAP,"Increase in drought events","Leads to","Water scarcity","The Lower Mekong Basin (LMB) has experienced some severe droughts in the past three decades and these droughts inflicted significant  harmful levels of salinity intrusion, and widespread shortage for domestic and industrial water use. Notably, droughts in 1991–1994 and 2015–2016 were the longest and driest droughts, respectively leading to water scarcity."
11,"Lowland Rice",EAP,"Rising sea levels","Leads to","Saline intrusion","Salt intrusion due to sea level rise has already caused agricultural productivity to decrease and rice production to decline. One particular severe salinity intrusion in 2016 affected 270,000 hectares of rice."
12,"Lowland Rice",EAP,"Decrease in average precipitation","Leads to","Shorter growing seasons","A simulation study showed that the start of the rice growing period (SGP) was delayed with reduced early rainfall during the 16-year period, leading to shorter growing seasons. The crop yield depends on rainfall distribution during growth, and the lack of irrigation water in the region makes this production system highly vulnerable to changes in precipitation."
13,"Lowland Rice",EAP,"Rising sea levels","Leads to","Coastal inundation","Dangers of sea-level rise include but are not limited to: land loss from the permanent inundation of low-lying coastal area."
14,"Lowland Rice",EAP,"Increase in average temperatures","Leads to","Shorter growing seasons","Shifting seasons are directly linked to warmer global temperatures: a slight change in temperature brings an earlier spring thaw and delays and water stress."

16,"Lowland Rice",EAP,"Increase in average temperatures","Leads to","Reduced crop productivity/failure","Productivity drops by as much as 4% per degree when temperature rise above 27 degrees celsius."
17,"Lowland Rice",EAP,"Rising sea levels","Leads to","Reduced water quality","In vietnam,  the snakehead fish farms in Tra Vinh or oyster farming areas in  Ben Tre experienced poor water quality in their ponds, rivers and water supplying sources, which was caused by saline intrusion and droughts. Negative impacts could have been mitigated if timely environmental quality information were made available to farmers."
18,"Lowland Rice",EAP,"Rising sea levels","Leads to","Increase in food spoilage/wastage","A predicted sea-level rise of 30 cm by the year 2050 is expected to accelerate salinity intrusion.A rise in the sea level of only 30 cm could see the loss of nearly 200,000 hectares of rice cultivation.nd planted with rice were affected by salinity intrusion and drought at the reproductive stage. Yields were reduced by 50-100%, or total loss."

21,"Lowland Rice",EAP,"Increase in drought events","Leads to","Dependence on food aid","Vietnam recorded an extreme drought event in 2019 in 5 of 13 provinces in the Mekong Delta, and an emergency was declared. New Zealand Embassy announced humanitarian aid, totalling US$50,000, to communities in Ben Tre Province affected by drought and saltwater intrusion."
22,"Lowland Rice",EAP,"Water scarcity","Leads to","Reduced crop productivity/failure","Rice production is increasingly constrained by water scarcity during drought events. Water scarcity is a contributing barrier to adoption of technology in the lowland system"
23,"Lowland Rice",EAP,"Soil salinisation","Leads to","Reduced crop productivity/failure","The risks of increasing saline intrusion and permanent inundation due to sea level rise, will significantly reduce the land suitable for rice cultivation in the Mekong delta by 50 % by 2050. Acid sulfate soils are forming as salty crusts on the soil surface in some
areas, because of high salinity levels of the water causing unfavourable condition for rice production."
24,"Lowland Rice",EAP,"Saline intrusion","Leads to","Reduced crop productivity/failure","It was shown that seawater intrusion was the major factor leading to regional differences in rice cropping systems and land use patterns. In the Mekong Delta region, the worst saline intrusion occurs in rice production due to failed monsoons, and climate change leading to reduced yields."
25,"Lowland Rice",EAP,"Land degradation","Leads to","Sediment starvation","Soil erosion due to land degradation has led to high levels of sediments starvations in the coastal zones of of Asia."
26,"Lowland Rice",EAP,"Water scarcity","Leads to","Increase in food insecurity","Low yields due to rain-fed lowlands experiencing drought is a common problem throughout Asia, with an estimated 45% of the total rice area, leading to food insecurity."

32,"Lowland Rice",EAP,"Coastal inundation","Leads to","Increased flooding
","In South and Southeast Asia, where the majority of the world's rice farmers live, flooding is a major limitation on yield caused by inundation."
33,"Lowland Rice",EAP,"Elevation loss","Leads to","Damage to infrastructure","According to the IPCC's simulations, Asia, for example, is expected to experience damage to urban infrastructure due to flooding caused by elevation loss."
34,"Lowland Rice",EAP,"Coastal inundation","Leads to","Damage to infrastructure","The area's coastal regions are also susceptible to inundation associated with sea level rise and destruction of infrastructure from flooding and storm surges."
35,"Lowland Rice",EAP,"Elevation loss","Leads to","Increased flooding
","Elevation loss increases the vulnerability to flooding and storm surges, and ultimately threatens the Delta with permanent inundation. Without adaptation, land that will be below sea level may be permanently inundated and no longer suitable for agriculture."
36,"Lowland Rice",EAP,"Major component of local diet","Leads to","Dependence on food aid","The emergence of severe droughts in the Mekong Delta has resulted in huge crop failures, with 90% of sowed fields perishing in the drought-impacted regions.This devastating drought damaged up to 30% of 29,900 ha rice in2019"
37,"Lowland Rice",EAP,"Unsustainable land management practices","Leads to","Land degradation","Continuous rice cultivation, using unbalanced mineral fertilisers and only low inputs of organic manure, is in some situations seriously deteriorating the physical and chemical properties of the soil with adverse consequences on crop yields."

44,"Lowland Rice",EAP,"Inadequate climate information services","Leads to","Crop stress/damage/mortality","Information on lternative planting practices is lacking and farmers are only eligible for subsidies if they plant rice. Therefore, many farmers planted rice even though they know that it was risky. Hence, the competition for scarce water increased and resources, like seeds and fertilizer, were wasted."

The water discharge in upstream of Mekong river declined by 900m3/s. Meanwhile, water levels in middle and downstream of Mekong River increased by 0.1 – 1.5m due to tidal rise. Salinity intrusion led to increased salinity of water in rivers and irrigation canals."
55,"Lowland Rice",EAP,"Lack of irrigation infrastructure","Leads to","Reduced crop productivity/failure","There is limited scope for further expansion of irrigation systems. Only a few countries are in the fortunate position of under-exploiting their water resources. In some areas, serious shortages of irrigation water occur in the dry season. However, water use efficiencies are often low."

Public lands are typically not valued in the same manner as private lands, as the cost of public resource use is not incurred by the individual. These land management systems tend to result in resource overexploitation.  In Peru, it was noted that fallow land is purchased by large scale commodity producers, disregarding customary land ownership, thereby forcing subsistence farmers to move to new areas. Farmers are less likely to invest in modern technologies and practices if their land ownership is insecure and they are not guaranteed to reap the benefits of their efforts. Weak land tenure not only discourages farmers' investment in sustainable land management practices but it restricts their access to credit and risk insurance, and therefore their financial capacity to adopt such practices.

Silvopastoral systems are another climate smart approach to improving agricultural productivity. Silvopastoral systems provide shade, reducing body temperatures of grazing cattle by up to 4˚C compared with pasture-only systems. Some examples of climate smart pasture management options include not exceeding land carrying capacity, planting drought tolerant fodder crops (e.g. BRS Paiaguas), no tillage, intercropping of grasses and legumes for pasture diversification, and implementing manure management systems for improved soil quality."

For example, the 2014-2016 droughts in the dry Pacific region of Central America resulted in 1.6 million people becoming food insecure and 3.5 million requiring humanitarian assistance. The Government of Guatemala distributed food aid to over 290,000 affected families in 2014  and programmes were reinstated in 2015. The drought resulted in losses in agricultural production which affected the availability and access to staple crops, primarily maize and beans, enhancing the vulnerabilities of a country where almost a third of the population (30.7%) was already food insecure.

For example, under a scenario of a 2.5˚C to 4.9˚C temperature rise, rice yields are projected to drop by 32%-40% in India. Studies already indicate a decline in the productivity of the summer rice crop (Aus) in Bangladesh due to increasing temperatures."
1451,"Rice",SA,"Increase in extreme rainfall events","Leads to","Flash floods","Heavy rainfall events in India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka lead to flash floods (sudden local flooding of low-lying areas) which damages rice crops, infrastructure and poses a threat to human life and livelihoods."
1452,"Rice",SA,"Decrease in average precipitation","Leads to","Reduced crop productivity/failure","Studies indicate that the impact of changes in precipitation patterns on rice production and food security will worsen in South Asia. For example, in Bangladesh, Boro (dry season) rice production is projected to decline due to limited availability of surface water and a depletion of groundwater levels. Decreasing rainfall is also expected to reduce the yields of rainfed Aus and Aman rice, resulting in a higher demand for supplemental irrigation."
1453,"Rice",SA,"Decrease in average precipitation","Leads to","Reduced groundwater tables","Decreases in regional precipitation patterns and increases in drought events contribute to water scarcity and an increased demand for irrigation using groundwater resources, and a subsequent depletion thereof. For example, in India, the extraction of groundwater in rice cropping systems to cope with climate-induced drought has led to a rapid decline in the groundwater table, which is expected to worsen in the future. In Bangladesh, declining rainfall patterns have reduced groundwater infiltration and runoff supply to wetlands and seasonally flooded areas, reducing aquifer recharge and resulting in a decline in groundwater tables."
1454,"Rice",SA,"Decrease in average precipitation","Leads to","Water scarcity","Rainfall in South Asia is becoming less predictable with some areas experiencing a decline in average precipitation thereby contributing to water scarcity. For example, in Bangladesh,  projections from 17 general circulation models (GCMs) for the period 2031–2050 indicate lower rainfall (21–75%) which is expected to reduce river discharge by 5–18%."

1460,"Rice",SA,"Increase in average temperatures","Leads to","Increase in diseases","Crop and livestock pests and diseases are two major indirect effects of climate change in  South Asia. Pathogen life cycles, developmental rates, dissemination and geographical distributions are likely to change and adversely affect agricultural productivity."
1461,"Rice",SA,"Increase in drought events","Leads to","Reduced crop productivity/failure","The rice agricultural system requires large supplies of water and is therefore susceptible to drought stress. Drought is considered the most significant constraint to rice production in the region. Drought stress is very damaging to the rice crop during the reproductive stages, particularly during flowering, though drought at other stages can also result in significant yield losses.  Drought reduces rice leaf area, photosynthetic rate, above ground biomass and accelerates leaf senescence contributing to lower yields. Around 60% of the land used for rice production in Bangladesh is projected to be affected by seasonal drought by 2030, with a similar percentage in yield reduction. An increase in drought frequency in India has caused a rice yield reduction of 1.7% and the drought of 2002 led to a 20% reduction in rice productivity."
1462,"Rice",SA,"Increase in average precipitation","Leads to","Increased flooding
","Increases in average precipitation in several river basins has increased the frequency and scale of flooding in recent years. For example, in Sri Lanka, flooding is the most frequent and costly natural hazard, causing an estimated annual loss of USD 240 million. Coastal areas (south and southwest regions) of Bangladesh are prone to flooding and waterlogging due to high rainfall and limited drainage opportunities. Unevenly distributed rainfall patterns in Bangladesh are expected to enhance flooding disasters."
1463,"Rice",SA,"Increase in extreme heat (no. of hot days)","Leads to","Reduced crop productivity/failure","Heat stress adversely affects rice as high temperatures (in conjunction with high humidity) cause spikelet sterility and reduce grain quality. During the vegetative stage rice is relatively heat tolerant, but is sensitive to heat stress in the reproductive stage. Decreased grain weight, grain filling and a higher percentage of white chalky rice are some of the negative effects on rice during the ripening stage."
1464,"Rice",SA,"Rising sea levels","Leads to","Coastal inundation","Although rice is a semiaquatic plant it is not tolerant to long-periods of complete submergence. For example, in the Khulna region of Bangladesh, losses of 10% of Aus and Aman rice and 18% Boro rice are expected in the 2050s, largely due to sea level rise."

1467,"Rice",SA,"Increase in pests","Leads to","Reduced crop productivity/failure","In South Asia, leaf and stem pests represents 4.5% of total rice yield losses. For example, in India, an increase of 0.4˚C average surface temperature over the past century has led to increases in rice insect pest losses from 10% to 25%. Outbreaks of rice insect pests such as the green leaf hopper and brown planthopper are said to be the result of changing weather patterns."
1468,"Rice",SA,"Saline intrusion","Leads to","Reduced crop productivity/failure","Saltwater intrusion from sea-level rise in low-lying rice production areas will decrease crop productivity. Research has shown that for every unit of salinity increase, a 12% reduction in rice yield can result. Rice production in the coastal areas of Bangladesh has already declined due to an increase in salinity."
1469,"Rice",SA,"Soil salinisation","Leads to","Reduced crop productivity/failure","Rice is a moderately salt sensitive crop, with its photosynthesis, protein synthesis, and metabolism affected under high salinity conditions. Salinisation causes osmotic stress and Na+ toxicity in rice. For example, in India, salinity stress affects nearly 6.7 million ha of rice cultivated land which constitutes about 15.8% of the total harvested area. In Bangladesh, soil salinity is expected to affect 20% of the total paddy cultivation area, leading to a potential loss of 395,000 tonnes of rice."
1470,"Rice",SA,"Flash floods","Leads to","Reduced crop productivity/failure","Currently 20 million ha of rice are subject to submergence caused by flash flooding, mostly in India and  Bangladesh. Rice production losses in Bangladesh and India due to flash floods are estimated to be around 4 million tonnes per year."
1471,"Rice",SA,"Increased flooding
","Leads to","Reduced crop productivity/failure","Flooding from heavy rain and river overflow has impacted negatively on rice production in the region. Although a semiaquatic plant, rice is generally intolerant of complete submergence and plants die within a few days when completely submerged. As rice crops tend to be in an active stage of development and farmers have already made large investments in inputs, when flooding occurs the degree of damage is often serious and irreparable. Furthermore, farmers then miss the growing season as flooded fields cannot be used immediately. For example, in Bangladesh, flooding is likely to cause a decline in rice production by 8%–17% by 2050. In the early harvest period (April/May) floods frequently damage ripening rice in the Upper Meghna River Basin of Bangladesh."
1472,"Rice",SA,"Reduced crop productivity/failure","Leads to","Increase in food insecurity","Climate change in South Asia is expected to enhance fluctuations in crop production, food supplies, and market prices thereby aggravating food insecurity.
