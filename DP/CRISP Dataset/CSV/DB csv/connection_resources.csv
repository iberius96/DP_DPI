The Government of Guatemala distributed food aid to over 290,000 affected families in 2014  and programmes were reinstated in 2015. The drought resulted in losses in agricultural production which affected the availability and access to staple crops, primarily maize and beans, enhancing the vulnerabilities of a country where almost a third of the population (30.7%) was already food insecure.

These land management systems tend to result in resource overexploitation.  In Peru, it was noted that fallow land is purchased by large scale commodity producers, disregarding customary land ownership, thereby forcing subsistence farmers to move to new areas. Farmers are less likely to invest in modern technologies and practices if their land ownership is insecure and they are not guaranteed to reap the benefits of their efforts.

For example, in Sri Lanka, flooding is the most frequent and costly natural hazard, causing an estimated annual loss of USD 240 million. Coastal areas (south and southwest regions) of Bangladesh are prone to flooding and waterlogging due to high rainfall and limited drainage opportunities. Unevenly distributed rainfall patterns in Bangladesh are expected to enhance flooding disasters.","https://www.government.nl/binaries/government/documenten/publications/2019/02/05/climate-change-profiles/Bangladesh.pdf"

Drought is considered the most significant constraint to rice production in the region. Drought stress is very damaging to the rice crop during the reproductive stages, particularly during flowering, though drought at other stages can also result in significant yield losses.  Drought reduces rice leaf area, photosynthetic rate, above ground biomass and accelerates leaf senescence contributing to lower yields. Around 60% of the land used for rice production in Bangladesh is projected to be affected by seasonal drought by 2030, with a similar percentage in yield reduction.

Furthermore, farmers then miss the growing season as flooded fields cannot be used immediately. For example, in Bangladesh, flooding is likely to cause a decline in rice production by 8%–17% by 2050.

Silvopastoral systems are another climate smart approach to improving agricultural productivity. Silvopastoral systems provide shade, reducing body temperatures of grazing cattle by up to 4˚C compared with pasture-only systems. Some examples of climate smart pasture management options include not exceeding land carrying capacity, planting drought tolerant fodder crops (e.g. BRS Paiaguas), no tillage, intercropping of grasses and legumes for pasture diversification, and implementing manure management systems for improved soil quality.",

The Government of Guatemala distributed food aid to over 290,000 affected families in 2014  and programmes were reinstated in 2015. The drought resulted in losses in agricultural production which affected the availability and access to staple crops, primarily maize and beans, enhancing the vulnerabilities of a country where almost a third of the population (30.7%) was already food insecure.

The impact severity varied by country, with smallholder farmers in Costa Rica much less likely to be food insecure following extreme weather events than farmers in Honduras or Guatemala.

It is projected that by 2025, bean production in Central America could be reduced by more than 20%. Nicaragua and Honduras, the main bean-producing countries, can expect yield losses of 14%. El Salvador will suffer a reduction of 7%, but Guatemala might increase its overall production because of its highlands. In Honduras, El Salvador and Nicaragua, and in poor soil simulations, maize yields are expected to decline by more than 15% by 2025.

Drought has a considerable impact on maize and bean yields at the household level, especially in terms of access to food and the stability of food supplies. For example, the 2014-2016 droughts in the dry Pacific region of Central America resulted in 1.6 million people becoming food insecure and 3.5 million requiring humanitarian assistance. The Government of Guatemala distributed food aid to over 290,000 affected families in 2014  and programmes were reinstated in 2015. The drought resulted in losses in agricultural production which affected the availability and access to staple crops, primarily maize and beans, enhancing the vulnerabilities of a country where almost a third of the population (30.7%) was already food insecure. Furthermore, studies in Guatemala suggest that there is a close relationship between precipitation extremes, crop failure and hunger, particularly in children under five years of age.","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308521X16301160"

Drought reduces rice leaf area, photosynthetic rate, above ground biomass and accelerates leaf senescence contributing to lower yields. Around 60% of the land used for rice production in Bangladesh is projected to be affected by seasonal drought by 2030, with a similar percentage in yield reduction.

Farmers are less likely to invest in modern technologies and practices if their land ownership is insecure and they are not guaranteed to reap the benefits of their efforts.

Wheat is more sensitive to heat stress than rice, with damage to the photosynthetic apparatus at temperatures >30˚C. Temperatures >33.7˚C at anthesis causes panicle sterility due to poor anther dehiscence and >34˚C during grain formation substantially reduces grain yields.

The use of biodegradable mulching materials protects the soil from direct rainfall impact and reduces evaporation.
