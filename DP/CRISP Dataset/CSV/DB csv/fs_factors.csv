"1","Lowland Rice","EAP","Increase in average temperatures","Hazard","Increase in Temperature of 0.02-0.03 °C per year by 2050 across the entire region is expected"
"2","Lowland Rice","EAP","Rising sea levels","Hazard","The tides are rising at a rate close to ~2 cm/year, and salinity has increased by approximately 0.2–0.5 PSU/year.  Sea levels are expected to rise in the region by 45-75 cm by 2090.  Average sea level rise of 3 mm per year over the last 30 years . This is a major threat to a part of the world which, on average, is less than 2 metres above sea level."
"3","Lowland Rice","EAP","Increase in drought events","Hazard","The risk of drought often occurs during the Winter-Spring rice crops, particularly in El Niño years. Severe drought years such as 1977–1978, 1997–1998, 2015–2016 and 2019–2020 are all related to El Niño events, which greatly affect production and life in the Mekong Delta. During low river flow periods, between March and April, saline water intrudes up to 40–50 km inland from estuaries through main river systems  and about 100,000 ha of rice annually is at high risk of dry-season salinity intrusion."
"4","Lowland Rice","EAP","Increase in average precipitation","Hazard","In recent years, farmers in many provinces have had to readjust the crop calendar, to rotate rice with short-term crops, or to convert their rice land to aquaculture. It is worth noting that the rate of increase in aquaculture area in the Mekong Delta experienced an important surge after El Ninõ 2015–2016 (mean annual increase of 18.3 T ha in 2016–2019, as compared to 4.25 T ha in 2008–2015). Rainfall has increased at the end of the rainy season but decreased at the beginning of the rainy season over the last 10 years. Shifting rainfall patterns such as these can have an adverse effect on the agricultural productivity of the Mekong Delta. A 30% annual increase in precipitation has been observed."
"5","Lowland Rice","EAP","Decrease in average precipitation","Hazard","The temperature has increased, annual rainfall has decreased and is distributed less evenly, and the dry season lasts longer. Results indicate a significant downward trend in rainfall in the Kien Giang, Soc Trang, and Ca Mau provinces, where the rice-growing areas are mainly based on rainfall. Therefore, these areas have a potential risk of water shortages, resulting in increased production costs especially during the winter-spring crop season, and a rice productivity decline, which would indirectly contribute to threatening the food security of the region and Vietnam as a whole."
"6","Lowland Rice","EAP","Saline intrusion","Impact","The risks of increasing saline intrusion and permanent inundation due to sea level rise, will significantly reduce the land suitable for rice cultivation in the Mekong delta by 50 % by 2050. Coastal provinces are strongly affected by saline intrusion from the second half of December to the end of April. Recently, saline intrusions tend to occur earlier, with increased salinity concentrations and duration, and are more invasive in the fields. Salinity intrusion is associated with low water discharge from upstream of the Mekong River. This is caused by the below average rainfall in the Mekong basin due to the El Niño. With insufficient upstream water flow to push back seawater, salinity intrusion increased in concentration and duration. It was also aggravated by the drought and high temperature in the region. Salinity intrusion is also caused by the construction of dams further upstream on the Mekong River and dams on the lower Mekong River, which reduce water flow and prevent the renewal of the delta silt deposits."
"7","Lowland Rice","EAP","Shorter growing seasons","Impact","In recent years, farmers in many provinces have had to readjust the crop calendar, to rotate rice with short-term crops, or to convert their rice land to aquaculture. It is worth noting that the rate of increase in aquaculture area in the Mekong Delta experienced an important surge after El Ninõ 2015–2016 (mean annual increase of 18.3 T ha in 2016–2019, as compared to 4.25 T ha in 2008–2015)."
"8","Lowland Rice","EAP","Increased flooding","Impact","Seasonal river flooding, which coincides with the rainy season that runs from May to November, plays a critical role in the health of the Mekong river system. These floods deposit sediments, which improve soil fertility, flush out polluted waters, and recharge the groundwater tables. However, excessive flooding during the rainy season are becoming more frequent, and structural elements are not expected to hold up under an increasingly severe climate regime, which is driving sea-level rise (SLR) and changing meteorological and hydrological conditions. Chnages in climate are also causing flooding and drought in Lao PDR"
"9","Lowland Rice","EAP","Water scarcity","Impact","The Mekong Delta is one of a number of localised agricultural regions in the world that face acute water risks, which we have identified as water-risk “hotspots” that require a targeted policy response. These water risks are not only the result of climate change but involve a range of factors, including farming itself, that cause water shortages, floods and degradation of water quality, extensive dam-building and ground water pumping."
"10","Lowland Rice","EAP","Reduced crop productivity/failure","Impact","Climate change by 2050 will cause a significant reduction in rice yield, but the projections  depend on the rice crop season and the geographical area. Vast tracks of land planted with rice are affected by salinity intrusion and drought at the reproductive stage. Yields were reduced by 50-100%, or total loss. Shifting rainfall patterns  have an adverse effect on the agricultural productivity of the Mekong Delta.  Estimates of changes in crop productivity due to climate change are in the range of 2-30% over a 20-30 year period."

"21","Lowland Rice","EAP","Increase in food insecurity","Impact","Frequent droughts and reduced crop productivity in various countries is increasing the threats of food insecurity."
"22","Lowland Rice","EAP","Dependence on food aid","Impact","Vietnam recorded an extreme drought event in 2019 in 5 of 13 provinces in the Mekong Delta, and an emergency was declared. New Zealand Embassy announced humanitarian aid, totalling US$50,000, to communities in Ben Tre Province affected by drought and saltwater intrusion."
"23","Lowland Rice","EAP","Limited uptake of modern technologies","Vulnerability","The capacity of agencies to provide accurate information for drought and salinity forecasting and early warning systems is limited. The distribution of updated information on salinity levels is slow. In Vietnam, it takes a long time until salinity measurements reach the farmers. Collected information has to first be elevated to and approved by high-level decision makers before it is distributed to the local level. Thus, farmers get outdated information on salinity. It would be beneficial if the process would be smoother and the information flow more direct without passing many entities."

"28","Lowland Rice","EAP","Inconsistencies in policy implementation","Vulnerability","Inconsistencies were observed in subsidy policies being implemented. During the winter spring season, farmers were recommended to reduce their planted areas to avoid losses. However, subsidies were only provided to farmers who had planted rice regardless of the warnings. The farmers who followed the recommendations did not receive any subsidy and/or support."
"29","Lowland Rice","EAP","Large contributor to national GDP","Vulnerability","The Mekong River Delta (MRD) is the rice basket of Vietnam producing 56% of the total domestic rice production and accounting for 90% of Vietnam’s rice export. Over 1.7 million hectares of land, more than half of the total arable land in the region, are being used for rice production."

"33","Lowland Rice","EAP","Fragmented landscapes","Vulnerability","Increasing fragmentation of farmland has resulted from a growing agricultural population and the absence of primogeniture to maintain the integrity of holdings. In many instances farm sizes are now uneconomic, and even with the adoption of best practices would still only be marginal in terms of livelihood. If this trend is not reversed, an increasing proportion of farmers will be unable to rely on agriculture to ensure adequate food security and income levels. As a consequence, on-farm employment, and even complete exit from the system (e.g. permanent migration to urban areas), is likely to occur on a much larger scale."
"34","Lowland Rice","EAP","Lack of irrigation infrastructure","Vulnerability","Lack of irrigation water is affecting productivity in the lowland system. For instance, the low yield in Winter-Spring rice in Tra Vinh could be linked to the lack of irrigation water and saline intrusion during the dry season."

"37","Lowland Rice","EAP","Lack of access to improved crop varieties","Vulnerability","In most countries, seed is generally of poor quality and not necessarily of the most recently recommended variety, because most farmers retain their own seed for replanting for many seed generations. While research services and private companies have developed new crop varieties - including hybrids - with higher yield potential and better local adaptability, they are often unavailable to the majority of farmers or are unsuited to their production practices. Production of seed of improved rice varieties is undertaken in many countries by government services, but quantities are generally much less than required by farmers. This situation has a serious adverse effect on crop yield and overall crop production."

"45","Lowland Rice","EAP","Diversify livelihoods","Adaptation option","Traditional rice-based farming systems in the region have always been diversified but cropping intensity was mostly low. Farmers have grown various food and non-food crops and raised livestock mainly to meet their domestic needs  Some of the practices in diversifying farming systems included livestock, horticulture, annual and perennial trees combined with livestock. These however depend on a stable supply of water for irrigation."

Design a forward-looking breeding program for the development of new ‛designer’ varieties that fit the new cropping systems and carry the package of traits required for  climate resilience. These varieties should have optimum maturing periods (duration) based on available windows of opportunities and should also combine tolerance of current and foreseen abiotic stresses, such as salinity, drought and heat stress."
"49","Lowland Rice","EAP","Improve climate change awareness","Adaptation option","Many local farmers do not follow warnings and instructions of local authorities based on rice cultivation calendars, climate and weather forecasts.

Vietnam has successfully implemented the cut-off date to avoid flooding/submergence in flood prone area, and a similar approach should be applied to saline areas."
"51","Lowland Rice","EAP","Invest in agricultural research and development","Adaptation option","Integrated form of participatory research and extension should be developed and promoted, with less emphasis on single-crop research. This would benefit from synergies between productive activities, and would consider the whole-farm production system - including the sustainability of natural resources and the protection of the environment.

This would reduce salinity intrusion in the region."
"54","Lowland Rice","EAP","Build the capacity of agricultural extension agents","Adaptation option","The capacity of  agencies to provide accurate information for drought and salinity forecasting and early warning systems is limited. This is aggravated by poor mechanisms for coordination, sharing of data and standardization of collected data among relevant ministries, line departments, local authorities, farmers and water users. For example, different teams from provincial departments are doing the  monitoring of water quality in the provinces, but data from these teams could not combined with salinity monitoring at commune levels because of problems in coordination and inconsistence in monitoring methods."
"55","Lowland Rice","EAP","Improve access to climate information services","Adaptation option","Existing national, regional and provincial salinity information systems are effective for managing irrigation infrastructure to access both saline and fresh water at the macro level. However information is insufficient to warn rice growers in time when water management infrastructure fails or is unable to protect their fields. If farmers measure and disseminate information about salinity variability in their immediate environment in cooperation with local authorities, communities can make collective decisions and put strategies in place to minimize the risks of salinity intrusion in their rice fields. A real-time salinity monitoring and advisory service in selected salinity-affected communities is needed."
"56","Lowland Rice","EAP","Develop/improve early warning systems","Adaptation option","The development of an improved climate monitoring and early warning system should be prioritized to help mitigate negative impacts induced by climate change in the Mekong Delta.

"178","Upland Intensive Mixed","EAP","Limited uptake of modern technologies","Vulnerability","Farmers in East Asia  tend to be conservative and prefer to use traditional methods. In addition, technology development typically focuses on specific commodities, rather than on integrated development of a system  that takes into account various land use options and different agro-ecological zones."
"179","Upland Intensive Mixed","EAP","Unsustainable land management practices","Vulnerability","Shifting cultivation has historically been the main land use system of upland rural villages. Two to ten year rotations are applied and the major crop, upland rice, is cultivated with no external inputs or mechanisation. However, this is changing in many areas as farming is becoming market-oriented with shorter fallow periods, some permanent fields, and the use of irrigation and inputs. With the more intensive production and shorter fallow periods, soil fertility is declining and production is being adversely affected, rendering the system ecologically unsustainable. This change has come about mainly due to demographic pressure and land-use restrictions."
"180","Upland Intensive Mixed","EAP","Unequal opportunities for women","Vulnerability","Women tend to be marginalised in the upland intensive mixed agricultural system despite the vital role they play. Traditionally, women are responsible for tasks such as transplanting, weeding and harvesting, while men work in land preparation, crop management and marketing. Women are often excluded from decision-making roles and are paid less than men for the same work. Further, land ownership by women is rare, so their work is largely unrecognised."
"181","Upland Intensive Mixed","EAP","Weak land tenure","Vulnerability","Land tenure is typically weak in the upland intensive mixed system. Land tenure, land leasing and land markets are policy issues that have to be reviewed to promote agricultural development in upland areas."

For example, the  quality of upland rice production data for Laos is insufficient to inform decision making."
"192","Upland Intensive Mixed","EAP","Low access to agricultural extension services","Vulnerability","Access to agricultural extension services is generally low in the agricultural system due to the large number of poor farmers with small plots in geographically dispersed communities with underdeveloped transport and communication infrastructure. The lack of access to extension services affects knowledge sharing on modern agricultural technology and practices. Women are typically excluded from access to critical productive resources such as  extension services and information."
"193","Upland Intensive Mixed","EAP","Lack of access to  inputs","Vulnerability","Due to the remoteness and widespread poverty within the agricultural system, farmers tend to lack capital for seeds, fertilisers, pesticides and wages to hire workers to plant and harvest crops. Women are typically excluded from access to critical productive resources and services such as credit, farm inputs, marketing facilities, extension and information."
"194","Upland Intensive Mixed","EAP","Low level of education","Vulnerability","Due to the remoteness of the upland intensive mixed farming system, education levels are generally low as school attendance requires commuting. For example the household heads of two villages engaged in upland agriculture in Laos, namely, Ko Ngiaw and Navene, 43% and 21% had completed secondary-level education, respectively. It was noted that the farmers with higher levels of education possessed greater adaptive capacity."
"195","Upland Intensive Mixed","EAP","Low levels of climate change awareness at the farmer level","Vulnerability","In general, farmers in South East Asia are aware of climate change due to information gathered from newspapers, the internet, television, advertisements, and their community and friends. However, in the more remote areas of the upland intensive agricultural system, access to information, and therefore farmers' climate change awareness, is typically lower."
"196","Upland Intensive Mixed","EAP","Demographic pressure on land","Vulnerability","The East Asian and Pacific Islands region has a total population of 660.6 million, and is growing annually at 1.08% on average.

"206","Upland Intensive Mixed","EAP","Capacity building on sustainable agricultural practices","Adaptation option","Sustainable soil and water management practices should be promoted to improve crop yields and ensure maintenance of soil productivity."
"207","Upland Intensive Mixed","EAP","Implement agroforestry practices","Adaptation option","Agroforestry is a key climate change adaptation strategy as it provides multiple harvests at different times of the year. The diverse combination of crops buffers farmers from the risk of income loss due to climate variability, price fluctuations and other unexpected problems. On steeper lands such as in the upland intensive mixed agricultural system, agroforestry should be promoted with contour planting of suitable tree species for production of fruits, timber, fuelwood and non-timber forest products."
"208","Upland Intensive Mixed","EAP","Plant multiple crop types","Adaptation option","The planting of multiple crops, such as in agroforestry systems, shifts reliance from one or two annual crops to a range of food and income-generating crops, thus reducing vulnerability to climate shocks. Further, the planting of multiple crop types can reduce the incidence of pests and diseases."
"209","Upland Intensive Mixed","EAP","Invest in agricultural research and development","Adaptation option","Government and researchers should engage farmers in local-level research, drawing upon their indigenous knowledge in the identification of climate change issues and co-developing adaptation means to meet their context-specific needs."
"210","Upland Intensive Mixed","EAP","Integrated weed management","Adaptation option","Integrated weed management (IWM) combines a variety of preventive, cultural, mechanical, and chemical practices to control weed infestations. Often a single weed management practice is not feasible due to the diversity of weed species and differing life cycles and survival strategies."

For example, integrated soybean–cattle systems have higher productivity than continuously grazed areas. Silvopastoral systems are another climate smart approach to improving agricultural productivity. Silvopastoral systems provide shade, reducing body temperatures of grazing cattle by up to 4˚C compared with pasture-only systems. Some examples of climate smart pasture management options include not exceeding land carrying capacity, planting drought tolerant fodder crops (e.g. BRS Paiaguas), no tillage, intercropping of grasses and legumes for pasture diversification, and implementing manure management systems for improved soil quality."

Barriers to accessing insurance include a lack of awareness, a lack of legal and regulatory frameworks, a lack of financial capability of the providers, a limited range of agricultural product, a lack of technical expertise, the high cost of insurance products and low levels of affordability by farmers."
"1123","Rice","SA","Water scarce area","Vulnerability","In South Asia, temperature increases of 1.5–2 °C could severely impact the availability of water resources due to increased monsoon variability. Water scarcity in agriculture is expected to worsen, exacerbated by increasing competition with other sectors. Furthermore, an increase in groundwater extraction to meet growing food demands is leading to a depletion of groundwater tables. For example, in Bangladesh, the area under Boro rice production has grown considerably over the past 30-40 years leading to a decline in groundwater levels and an eventual scarcity of dry season irrigation water."
