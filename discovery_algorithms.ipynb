      "{\"The maize-beans agricultural system covers predominantly upland areas from the Panama Canal to the highland plateau of Guatemala and Central Mexico, extending over an area of approximately 65 million ha (Dixon et al., 2001). The elevation of the agricultural system typically ranges between 400 - 2,000 masl, but reaches 3,500 masl in the Guatemalan highlands. Annual precipitation varies from 1,000 mm to 2,000 mm (Dixon et al., 2001). Soils are of volcanic origin and relatively fertile, but the prevalence of soil degradation and erosion is high, particularly on steep gradients and cleared land. The system is characterised by high levels of deforestation, forested areas in Guatemala and Honduras steadily decreased between 1990 and 2015 and Nicaragua lost half of its forest cover in the last half-century (Gourdji et al., 2015; Waddick, 2017). The decrease (especially in Honduras) is attributed to agricultural expansion. \\n\\nFarms are typically small, less than two hectares in size. For example, in Guatemala, Costa Rica and Honduras, the average coffee production area is 1.41 ha, 0.92 ha for maize and 0.57 ha for beans (Harvey et al., 2018). Yields tend to be low, with rainfed maize averaging 1.5 t/ha and beans 0.7 t/ha (Dixon et al., 2001; Eitzinger et al., 2012).\\n\\nMaize and beans form a vital component of the diets and culture of the agricultural system's population and smallholder farmers are key contributors to the national output of these crops. On-farm consumption is high, as noted by Harvey et al. (2018) who determined that less than a quarter of smallholder farmers sell their produce. Poverty is prevalent throughout the agricultural system (>30% of the population in Nicaragua and Honduras, 25% in Guatemala, and 20% in El Salvador), especially in the period before harvest (Dixon et al., 2001; Eitzinger et al., 2012). Coffee farmers typically experience higher incomes per unit of land than maize and bean producers. Coffee and small-scale vegetable production provide important income sources. \\n\\nPublic infrastructure is sparse or completely absent away from local administrative centres and road networks are largely inadequate. In El Salvador, the road network is usable only during the dry season, greatly restricting access to land and markets (Eitzinger et al., 2012). However, the rural access index (RAI) varies by country, for example, Bolivia's RAI is 48%, Costa Rica at 82% and Nicaragua at 28% (Perez, 2020). Similarly, the availability of education, health care and other services is generally poor. Although, levels of education vary between smallholder farmers in different landscapes. For example, Costa Rican farmers generally have higher levels of education than farmers in Guatemala and Honduras, and El Salvador has lower education levels than Honduras (Eitzinger et al., 2012). Most smallholder land ownership is by customary arrangement, making access to formal credit  difficult. To compensate, rural communities rely on social cohesion, enabling community mobilisation for a wide range of activities (Dixon et al., 2001).\": [6, 8]}\n",
