"Lowland rice (EAP)","Rice is  main staple food and it’s cultivated all East Asia and Pacific regions. In 2020, rice production amounted to approximately 42.7 million tonnes in Viet Nam making it  5th world rice-producing country and 2nd rice exporting country (GSO, 2021). The Mekong River Delta (MRD) region is known as the country’s ‘rice basket’, accounting for over half of the country’s domestic rice production, and 90% of the country’s rice exports (CCAFS, 2016).The rate of production growth of the Lowland Rice Farming System is expected to decline in the coming years due to the limited capacity for expansion of cultivated area, as well as an expected reduction of the historical rate of crop yield increases(Dixon,et al., 2001)
In addition, the region is under increasing threat from climatic and non-climatic hazards.  Increasing temperatures, sea level rise and reduced precipation are the main climatic hazards affecting the region (Thuy Le Toan et al, 2021); (Akam & Gruere, 2018); (CCAFS,2016); (Eslami et al., 2019); Smajgl et al., 2015;Cramb et al., 2015). Salinity intrusion as a result of sea level rise and declining  river flow is creating unfavourable conditions for rice production (Yen et al., 2019; Thuy Le Toan, et al, 2021; CCAFS, 2016;Cramb et al.,2015; Dixon,et al., 2001). In addition, retention of water in the upstream provinces for hydropower production is causing water shortages and sediments starvation in the case of  Mekong deltas thus exacerbating the vulnerabilities and salinity intrusion (CCAFS, 2016). Water scarcity is has increased investments in ground water piumping and irrigation infrastructure in most countries(CCAFS, 2016).  
 Other issues affecting the  Lowland Rice Farming System  include  high poverty prevelence in some countries, land fragmentation, unbalanced fertiliser use,  inefficient use of water resources. inferior seed quality, poor post-harvest management, limited farm diversification, and the absence of adequate local capacity for agricultural product processing(Dixon,et al., 2001).
To cope with these challenges, farmers and other stakeholders are adapting through large-scale mechanization, investment in irrigation infrastructure, water conservation technologies, livelihood diversification and planting of multiple rice varieties (Yen et al., 2019; CCAFS, 2016; Thuy Le Toan, et al, 2021; Cramb et al.,2015; Dixon,et al., 2001). Livestock and aquaculture farming are among the leading diversifiaction options in the region. If not mitigated, climate change coupled with other  factors could  lead to food insecurity, unemployment and economic crisis in the region (CCFAS, 2016; Akam & Gruere, 2018)."
"Temperate Mixed (EAP)","Developing countries of the East Asia and Pacific region are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. The poor in these countries are at especially high risk, given their heavy dependence on agriculture, strong reliance on ecosystem services, rapid growth and intense concentrations of population, and relatively poor health services. Developing countries are usually also characterized by insufficient capacity to adapt to climate change impacts, inadequate infrastructure, meager household income and savings, and limited support from public services. There is a real danger that climate change impacts may derail the significant progress countries in Asia and the Pacific have made toward achieving the Millennium Development Goals (V.Anbumozhi et al., 2012) . 
The temperate mixed farming system is faced by several climatic hazards such as, increased rainfall events, increased drought events, increase in frost events, salinization, shorter growing season, rising sea levels, increase in strong winds, tropical cyclone and hailstorms (J.Dixon et al.,2001); Finlayson.C. et al.,2019; K. Zahedi et al ., 2020 and ICRC, 2021). These hazards result to different biophysical and socio-economic impacts on key agricultural crops such as wheat, maize, livestock and pulses. The biophysical impacts include land degradation, reduced crop productivity, floods and increased incidences of bushfires(J.Dixon et al.,2001; Nithin Coca, 2020 and WMO,2021);. The socio economic effects on the other hand include increase in food prices, food insecurity, poverty and increased migration(G. Thapa and R. Gaiha, 2011). The farming system is also highly vulnerable to moderate poverty levels, livestock and crop susceptibility to pest and diseases, and over-reliance on rainfed agriculture(H. R. Gautam et al ., 2013). In addition, there are institutional vulnerabilities such as inadequate climate information and issues such as low access to markets and unstable commodity prices. Moreover, there exist vulnerabilities related to high prevalence to land degradation caused by multiple forces, including extreme weather conditions, particularly drought. Land degradation is also caused by human activities that pollute or degrade the quality of soils and land utility (Mubarik Ali et al.,2005; W. Juswanto and A. Zulfiqar,2016; ESCAP, 2018).
To cope with impacts already locked into the climate system, there is a need to develop and scale adaptation strategies such as; reforestation practices, investing in  irrigation infrastructure, investing in research and development, creation of climate change awareness, diversification of livelihoods, implementing climate smart agricultural practices and implementing disaster recovery strategies(R. Rajalahti, 2021; A. Roy and S. Basu,2020; Brescian .F. et al.,  2019). According to Dixon et al., (2001), further intensification of crop production will occur as a result of promotion of higher-yielding varieties; particularly hybrid varieties, better balanced use of fertilisers, increased water availability and more efficient water use. Greater emphasis should be given to small-scale intensive livestock production; mainly pigs and to growing vegetables and fruits, as market demand for these higher-value products will increase with rising urban incomes. Cattle have already been successfully fattened on a diet based on treated cereal straw, but government research and extension services will need to provide the appropriate technical advice and support for this changes in the production system. The Asian Development Bank Institute (ADBI), in collaboration with the Regional and Sustainable Development Department and other operational departments of the Asian Development Bank, have put in place integrated adaptation solutions to address the causes and consequences of climate change in the Asia and Pacific region, including areas with temperate mixed agri systems. The small scale producers especially in the rural areas needs to be included in the implementation of these adaptation options; there is need for financial and market inclusion (ADB, 2008; World Bank, 2015  and C. Odhong' et al., 2019) .  "
"Upland intensive mixed (EAP)","The East Asia and Pacific Islands region is highly vulnerable to climate change due to its extensive coastlines, seasonal monsoon patterns and a heavy reliance on agriculture, fisheries, forestry and other natural resources (Diana et al., 2022). Data indicates that extreme climatic events have occurred more frequently in the last twenty years (1999–2018) than the previous two decades (Bell & Taylor, 2015; Hellin et al., 2020). Climate change impacts on crop productivity are significant in the region and are especially pronounced under the RCP8.5 scenario (ASEAN, 2021). 

The productivity of the upland intensive mixed agricultural system is being adversely affected by climate hazards such as increasing average temperatures, drought events, extreme rainfall events, erratic rainfall and tropical cyclones. For example, higher average temperatures cause a decline in rice yields due to increased spikelet sterility and shortened growth duration. A 2°C increase in temperature could result in a decline of rice yields by 1 t/ha. In Malaysia, rice yields are projected to decline in the range of 5.9% to 30.9% by 2050 (Diana et al., 2022). In Vietnam, spring rice yields may decline by 717 kg/ha, and 795 kg/ha in summer–autumn rice. Oil palm production decreases from 2% to 5% for each 10°C increase in temperature. In Thailand, sugarcane yields are projected to drop by 23.95% under RCP4.5 and 33.26% under RCP8.5 (Pipitpukdee et al., 2020). For maize, soybean and cotton, yields increase up to 29°C, 30°C and 32°C, respectively, but temperatures above these thresholds are damaging (Taylor et al., 2016).

Drought stress has a significant impact on crop yields in the upland intensive mixed agricultural system (Mar et al., 2018; Stuecker et al., 2018; Taylor et al., 2016). Dry spells, even of short duration, can cause substantial yield losses particularly if they occur during the crop's flowering stage. For example, El Niño induced droughts in the Philippines result in substantial declines in rice and sugarcane yields (Stuecker et al., 2018). 

Heavy rainfall leading to flooding can delay farming operations, destroy entire crops over wide areas, damage seedling availability and restrict access to planting material and markets. Rice can thrive with periodic flooding, but it cannot survive prolonged submergence (Hellin et al., 2020). Sugarcane is very vulnerable to flooding which leads to a loss in yields. For example, the 2009 floods in Fiji cost USD 13 million in sugar losses (Taylor et al., 2016). Pulses are very sensitive to torrential rain, especially during the early vegetative stage and at flowering (Mar et al., 2018). Further, due to the steep slopes associated with the agricultural system, an increase in high-intensity rainfall can lead to landslides and soil erosion through the removal of fertile topsoils, thereby impacting upon crop productivity and sedimentation of surface water resources (Carandang, 2010; Dixon et al., 2001; Hellin et al., 2020; Taylor et al., 2016). Sudden changes in weather conditions result in outbreaks of pests and diseases causing a loss of yields (Carandang et al., 2016; Landicho et al., 2019; Mar et al., 2018). For example, an increase in minimum temperatures and increased humidity provide conditions conducive to the spread of taro leaf blight (Taylor et al., 2016). Population growth is a key driver of land use change in the upland areas leading to increased land scarcity, the need to intensify land use and to shorten traditional fallow cycles. Shorter fallow cycles and intensive tillage of steep gradients leads to soil erosion and a loss of soil fertility, particularly with heavy rainfall events. Such practices are therefore unsustainable in the long-term.

Within the agricultural system, the capacity of smallholder farmers to adapt to climate change is affected by the small size of farms (< 5 ha), insecure land titles and associated limited access to formal credit, poor road infrastructure and inaccessibility of markets, a lack of climate change awareness, and inadequate support from extension services (Dixon et al., 2001; FAO, 2018; Hepp et al., 2019; Mar et al., 2018). Further, due to the remoteness and widespread poverty within the agricultural system, farmers have limited access to agricultural inputs, with women farmers the worst affected (Oxfam, 2019).

Adaptation options to enhance the climate resilience of the farmers include off-farm income sources, climate change awareness campaigns, the promotion of sustainable soil and water management with a focus on practices such as agroforestry, planting of multiple crop types, integrated pest and weed management practices and diversification to livestock value chains (Carandang, 2010; Dixon et al., 2001; Hellin et al., 2020; Landicho et al., 2019; Schreinemachers et al., 2013). Capacity building of farmers requires access to extension agents with experience in participatory approaches (e.g. training of trainers) and demonstration plots. Policy issues surrounding land tenure and gender inequality need to be addressed to improve the adoption of sustainable agricultural practices, enhance agricultural productivity and reduce poverty in the upland areas (Dixon et al., 2001; Oxfam, 2019)."
"Coastal plantation and mixed farming (LAC)","Agriculture is important for LAC region’s economies, accounting for 5-18 percent of GDP in 20 countries in LAC, and an even larger share when broader contributions across food systems are considered (World Bank, 2020).  The coastal plantation and mixed farming is one of the agricultural systems in the region. The  principal livelihoods in this agrisystems predominantly depend on export crops/tree crops, fishing, tubers and tourism  (Dixon et al., 2001).  Just like the larger LAC region, countries within the coastal plantation and mixed farming system are heterogeneous  in terms of climate, ecosystems and population distribution. Some of the key climatic hazards affecting this system are;  Increase in average temperatures, increase in extreme heat (number of hot days), Increase in drought events, increase in extreme rainfall events  and decrease in average precipitation (WMO, 2020; WMO,2021).  Findings from  World Meteorological Organization (2020) indicate that hydrometeorological events, such as floods, storms, droughts and heatwaves, account for 93% of all disasters that took place over the last 20 years  in most of the countries in LAC including the coastal areas. The coastal mixed systems experience maritime related hazards which are a matter of concern. They include  rising sea levels, increase in tropical cyclones/hurricanes and ocean acidification (Iris M and Hazel A. , 2017; WMO, 2021). There has been massive loss of production of fish in internal lakes mainly due to destruction of their habitats by climate related hazards especially those that are maritime related. Other effects of Climate hazards in the  system include, reduced crop production or failure, saline intrusion, coastal erosion, coastal inundation, landslide events, flash floods , scarcity of water, increased food prices, high poverty rates and increased migration among many other impacts (Vergara, W et al., 2014; Iris M and Hazel A. , 2017; IICA,2017; Antonio M, 2018;  WMO, 2021; Onil B et al., 2021; ) . Some of key vulnerabilites include weak land tenure systems, reliance on rainfed agriculture, conflicts around resource allocation and high prevalence of land degradation where 306 million hectares of land in LAC, including the coastal mixed plantation areas are moderately or intensely degraded ( Fernando S, 2006; Antonio M, 2018 ; IICA, 2020;  Onil B et al., 2021).
Climate change is currently one of the greatest challenges facing environmental regulators. It is a growing crisis with economic, health and safety, food production, security, and other dimensions (UN, 2022).The UN Environment Programme works in Latin America and the Caribbean with governments, civil society and private sector to develop strategies and public policies for integrating climate change in development planning and investment (UN, 2022). 
Some of the adaptation and mitigation strategies include; Developing /improving early warning systems, Investing in water harvesting and storage infrastructure,Improving networking and knowledge exchange,Investing in irrigation infrastructure, Capacity building on sustainable agricultural practices, Diversification of livelihoods and use drought tolerant varieties (Brian Feld & Sebastian Galiani, 2015; D. Bordi et al.,2021; M Fay et al., 2017 ; E. Romjin et al., 2019 and J Sanjak et al., 2016). Top sectoral priorities for adaptation include water; agriculture and food security; health; ecosystems, biodiversity and forestry; infrastructure and cities; and disaster risk reduction (Brian Feld & Sebastian Galiani, 2015); Sperrati A, et al., 2015 and (World Bank; CIAT, 2015). Climate change may result in longer warm seasons, lack of rain, as well as an increase in the intensity and frequency of tropical storms. Sea-level rise will increasingly affect coastal communities, particularly in the small Caribbean islands. In the Caribbean, a region in constant disaster recovery, climate change-related risk factors may include temperature increases, greater vulnerability to drought, projected decrease in rainfall, coastal erosion, coral bleaching and threats to marine resources (Fernando Santibáñez and Paula Santibáñez, 2007; Antonio M, 2018; Onil B et al., 2021).
"
"Dryland Mixed (LAC)","The Latin American and Caribbean ( LAC) region is encompassed of countries that differ significantly in economic  and  demographic  profile  and  landscape. Projections show increasing mean temperatures of up to 4.5°C compared to pre-industrial levels by the end of this century across Latin America and the Caribbean (World Bank and USAID, 2017). One of the prevalent agri systems is the dryland  mixed farming system which is associated with climatic related challenges such as altered precipitation regimes, a strong increase in heat extremes, higher risks of drought and increasing aridity. The long dry season, frequent droughts and uncertain patterns of precipitation typical of the system, make farming a highly uncertain process for the vast majority of producers without access to supplemental irrigation (Dixon et al., 2001). Moreover, the mean intensity of tropical cyclones, as well as the frequency of the most intense storms exist and is projected to increase. The sea levels are also expected to rise by ~0.2–1.1 mm depending on warming level and region. These climatic related hazard will cause biophysical and socio-economic impact such as reduced maize and cassava yields and reduced livestock production. There is also a substantial risk of Amazon rainforest degradation with continuing warming (M.M.Rojas., 2017).
The physical and biophysical climate change impacts challenge human livelihoods through decreasing income from agricultural sector.  For example, based on  livestock, cassava and maize which  are important for dryland farming systems and LAC region economics and food security , Prager et al., ( 2020) showed that climate change lowered the average  growth  in  yields and output. Furthermore, there is evidence that human health and energy systems are also negatively affected. Other biophysical impacts include soil erosion, soil salinization, increased soil water deficits and livestock mortalities.  All this hazards leads to  high  levels  of  inequality  with the poverty rate reaching 30.1% of the total population (185 million) and extreme poverty reaching 10.7% (66 million) in 2018 (ECLAC, 2019).  These  impacts have contributed to trade deficits  in  several  LAC  regions,  suggesting  increased  exposure  to  food  insecurity  for  most countries (Prager et al., 2020). Some of the vulnerabilities to climate change in dryland mixed farming system include reliance on rainfed agriculture, inability to interpret climate information, susceptibility of crops and animals to pests and diseases and demographic pressure on land.  
As a means of adaptation, provision of alternative livelihood opportunities to sub-marginal farm families within the region would include incentives for the creation of agro-industry and other rural occupations, such as training of workers and tax benefits. Another strategic approach consists of diversification into higher value crops, dissemination of technologies that improve productivity in relation to moisture constraints- including development and dissemination of drought resistant varieties and species and encouragement for the replacement of maize, conservation agriculture technologies appropriate for small producers and small-scale irrigation where feasible. Land use planning should also be given priority to improve the identification of areas under risk. Meteorological research leading to specific drought forecasting all over the region would also be valuable. In addition to these major strategic approaches, public financing must be shifted away from emergency drought relief and similar programmes into activities that provide hope for future avoidance of these conditions (Dixon et al.,2001). The UN Environment Programme works in Latin America and the Caribbean with governments, civil society and private sector to address climate change priorities and to achieve greater understanding of the causes and impacts of climate change on the economy and human wellbeing. The organisation strives to strengthen local and national capacities to address the impacts of climate change; develop adaptation and mitigation strategies such as; diversification of livelihoods, soil erosion control measures (Ngigi M. W et al., 2021), and public policies  such as policy reforms and improving early warning signs (UNEP,2010) for integrating climate change in development planning and investment; and the implementation of pilot projects to catalyse the action on climate change."
"Forest based (LAC)","The IPCC suggests that projected rising temperatures and changes in precipitation will negatively impact forest-based agriculture in the Amazon region. In the northern areas of the Amazon, there is projected to be an increase in the number of dry days and drought frequency. In the southern areas, increased agricultural and ecological drought are projected for the mid-21st century (for 2°C of global warming level and above) (IPCC, 2022; USAID, 2018). Dry conditions lead to increased soil water deficits and plant evapotranspiration, negatively affecting crop yields. Reduced water availability in the Amazon is expected to negatively affect wheat, maize, and possibly soybean production as well as silviculture (WWF, 2007). Avocado production in Brazil and Venezuela is expected to decline due to drier conditions, and in Peru, areas highly suited to avocado production will likely decline by 54% (RCP 2.6) to 76% (RCP 8.5)(Gruter et al., 2022). 

The annual mean temperature in the Amazon region is projected to increase by 1.7°C to 5.3°C by 2085, further contributing to reduced crop productivity. For example, by 2050, maize and soybean yields are expected to reduce by 31% with a 4°C temperature increase and by 14% with a 2°C increase (Marengo et al., 2018; USAID, 2018). Coffee productivity is also susceptible to higher temperatures.  A strong decline in areas suitable for coffee production is projected for Colombia and Brazil, with an increase in unsuitable areas by 2050. Furthermore, farmers engaged in açaí production in the Amazon estuary region indicated that productivity declines in hot years (Tregidgo et al., 2020).

In the Amazon region, the number of days per year with maximum temperatures exceeding 35°C are expected to increase by more than 150 days by the end of the 21st century under the SSP5-8.5 scenario. Under the SSP1-2.6 scenario, the temperature exceedance is expected to increase by less than 60 days (IPCC, 2022). High temperatures can lead to heat stress in cattle, reducing feed intake and growth rates, increasing livestock mortality, and ultimately resulting in economic losses (Tapasco et al., 2019; USAID, 2018). Furthermore, climate change is expected to reduce fodder availability in the Amazon region. For example, around 80% of Amazon soy is produced for animal feed. With a 4°C mean global temperature increase, soybean production in the Brazilian Amazon is projected to decline by 44% by 2050, and with a 2°C temperature increase, it is projected to decline by 1.8%. Additionally, by 2100, it is projected that climate change will reduce pasture growth resulting in annual livestock productivity declines of up to 25% (average of various scenarios), compared with the base period of 1970–2010 (Tapasco et al., 2019; USAID, 2018).

Traditional subsistence forest-based agriculture is considered sustainable when plots are small and fallow periods long. Despite this, subsistence farming is expected to be greatly affected by climate change; which is concerning as it is the main livelihood for rural communities in the Amazon. Indigenous women in particular will be affected by the impacts of climate change on horticultural productivity, as they are traditionally in charge of this activity (USAID, 2018).

During the past 50 years, around 20% of the Amazon forest has been lost to deforestation (Maeda et al., 2020). This has largely been attributed to government policy promoting agricultural intensification (Marquardt et al., 2019). In Brazil, Bolivia, Peru and Colombia, the main cause of deforestation is agricultural expansion. Forest clearance for cattle pastures is the largest direct driver of deforestation on both small and large farms in the Brazilian Amazon. In Ecuador’s Amazon region, deforestation increased from 0.13% per annum in 2015 to 0.30% in 2017. In Colombia, deforestation increased by 14% between 2015 and 2016, and doubled between 2016 and 2017. In Brazil’s Legal Amazon, deforestation increased by 8.5% between 2017 and 2018 (FAO, 2019). 

The Amazon forests recycle 50-75% of annual rainfall back into the atmosphere and so are central to regulating rainfall for agricultural regions across South America (USAID, 2018). Projected changes in the climate combined with other threats including deforestation, put the Amazon’s ecosystems at risk (USAID, 2018). Such changes accelerate forest and biodiversity loss and decrease ecosystem services, which is detrimental to agricultural productivity. 

Agroforestry is a valuable climate change and deforestation adaptation option for forest-agriculture frontiers.  Agroforestry improves soil fertility, increases water availability, provides vegetation cover and maintains the microclimate. Furthermore, agroforestry has the potential to recover degraded lands and is an economically viable approach that can be integrated in grain, non-timber forest products and beef production systems. Other means of climate change adaptation include integrated crop–livestock management, silvopastoral systems and climate smart pasture management activities such as not exceeding land carrying capacity, planting drought tolerant fodder crops, no tillage, intercropping of grasses and legumes for pasture diversification, and implementing manure management systems for improved soil quality.

For subsistence farmers in the Amazon, climate change, low incomes, deforestation and environmental degradation are pressing challenges to agricultural productivity. There is a need for tailored agricultural, land use and tenure policies, developed in consultation with subsistence farming communities and commercial producers, to account for the differences in environmental and social impacts associated with each actor type, which depend on differences in their legal responsibilities, voluntary commitments and capacities (Gardiner et al., 2016). In addition, the establishment of payment for ecosystem services provides a valuable method for the maintenance and recovery of forest ecosystems and provides an extra source of income for rural families (Nobre et al., 2021)."
"High Altitude Mixed (Central Andes)","The high altitude mixed (Central Andes) farming system is highly vulnerable to climate change impacts, with seven of the nine vulnerability characteristics recognized in the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC): low coastal zones; arid and semi-arid areas; exposure to floods, droughts, and desertification; zones prone to natural disasters; areas of high urban pollution; fragile mountain ecosystems; and significant economic dependence on the production and export of fossil fuels (USAID, 2012).
The main agricultural value chains in the high altitude mixed (Central Andes) include tubers, sheep and grains. Examples of crop under these categories include Potato, Cañihua, Quinoa, Maize and Wheat. The system faces several Climate hazards which include heavy precipitation with associated flooding, heavy snow and frost, drought, occurrence of unpredictable rainfall patterns, shorter growing season, and  retreating of glaciers and cold surges along the Andes corridor (World Bank, 2014; USAID, 2017; Stäubli et al., 2018;  WMO 2020). There have been major impacts on the agrisystem as a result of  the increased climate hazards. They include, increased flooding and flash flood events due to extreme rainfall, landslide events, reduced crop and livestock productivity, emergence of new pests and diseases, increased food insecurity, loss of income, increase in migration and increase in poverty (Fiebig-Wittmaack, 2011; World Bank 2014; USAID, 2017; )
Major vulnerabilities to climate hazards include heavy dependence on rain-fed systems with predominantly small-scale subsistence farming, high poverty levels, emergence of new pests such as the Andean potato weevil, poor water use efficiency and management and unsustainable natural resource use. Unsustainable agricultural practices are also common (World Bank, 2014;SINAGERD et al., 2014; USAID, 2017 ). There are also institution and policy challenges including weak land tenure and access rights for women, inadequate climate information services and inconsistencies in policy implementation (SINAGERD et al., 2014; USAID, 2017). Other major factors that contribute to a lack of capacity to cope and adapt include low level of education, lack of road infrastructure and unequal opportunities for women (Bergmann et al., 2021; UNDP, 2018)
Farmers within the agri system have had to deal with natural phenomena such as El Niño and extreme weather events impacting on the area of land under agriculture, thus increasing their exposure to climate hazards.  The major risks are food insecurity and loss of livelihood. For example, with 80 per cent of farmers in Peru practicing subsistence farming, increased climate risks in the agricultural sector will directly affect food security and livelihoods of the farmers (Mächtle, 2016; USAID, 2017; Bergmann et al., 2021)
Among the adaptation strategies being implemented are; reforestation practices, investment in irrigation and water harvesting, investment in storage infrastructure, implementation of efficient water management and diversification of livelihoods (Bergmann et al., 2021; USAID, 2017; Fiebig-Wittmaack, 2011). Women have a profound knowledge of their environment and often play a greater role than men in the management of natural resources. Through their experiences, responsibilities and strength, women are a primary resource for adaptation and their roles should be strengthened by government (Schoolmeester et al., 2016)"
"Irrigated (LAC)","Central and South America are highly exposed, vulnerable and strongly impacted by climate change (IPCC, 2022). Several extreme events are already impacting the region and are projected to intensify including increasing temperatures and aridity, sea level rise, increasing frequency and severity of drought, and an associated decrease in water supply. These climate hazards and impacts have adverse effects on agricultural production (IPCC, 2022). 

The irrigated agricultural system, undertaken in Mexico, Peru, Argentina and Chile, is subject to an increasing frequency and severity of drought and worsening aridification. For example, in Mexico, rainfall patterns are influenced by the El Niño Southern Oscillation, which increases drought during the dry season (Ochoa-Noriega et al., 2020). Chile has suffered a mega-drought event, and according to climate change projections, will likely see increases in drought frequency. In Central-Western Argentina, hydrological drought severity has increased since 2017 and is affecting several river basins (Rivera et al., 2021). Drought causes water scarcity and ultimately reduced agricultural productivity in the irrigated system, for example, in Chile, drought is projected to have a significant impact on the production of fruit farmers, and in Mexico, farmers highlighted drought as the main cause for agricultural losses, with Baja California, Sonora, and Sinaloa being the worst affected areas (Ochoa-Noriega et al., 2020). In Central-West Argentina, drought (2010/2011- 2014/2015) resulted in water shortages, reducing grape and seasonal crop production as well as the loss of livestock, negatively impacting regional food security (Rivera et al., 2021).

Central and South America has experienced a warming of 0.2˚C–0.3˚C per decade since 1980 and a warming of 1.8˚C–3.9 ˚C and 1.9˚C–5.0˚C is projected by 2100, respectively (Hagen et al., 2022). Maximum and minimum temperatures are projected to increase across Mexico and Peru’s coastal lowlands, and Chile is projected to experience increases in temperature across the country. Extreme heat is projected for Argentina, with heat waves impacting the northern region the most, however, some areas to the southwest have already experienced an increase in days with extreme heat (Hagen et al., 2022; World Bank, 2021). Heat stress results in significant reduction in yield and harvest quality in fruit crops (Sharma and Manjeet, 2020). It causes damage to crop leaves (e.g. burning or scorching), twig burning, leaf senescence and abscission, shoot and root growth inhibition, bark cracking, delayed flowering/fruiting, poor fruit setting due to reduced sterility, fruit drop, fruit discoloration and overall poor fruit quality. Furthermore, cattle production and productivity are affected when temperatures exceed 27 °C, especially if relative humidity is higher than 40% (Zazueta-Gutiérrez et al., 2021).

The predominant vulnerability limiting the resilience of the irrigated agricultural system is water scarcity due to overexploitation of surface and groundwater resources for agricultural expansion in conjunction with climate hazards such as increasing drought occurrence, reduced precipitation and increasing temperatures. Important adaptation options include improved water use efficiency, adoption of water efficient irrigation systems, rainwater harvesting and storage infrastructure, establishment of water user associations, strengthened water use regulations, and government partnerships with research institutions to develop evidence-informed policy. In addition, there is a need to build the capacity of farmers to adopt sustainable water use practices, and to improve access to financial resources to enable small-scale farmers to purchase modern, efficient irrigation technology and equipment."
"Maize-beans (LAC)","Central America is highly exposed and vulnerable to climate change with extreme events already impacting the region and projected to intensify (IPCC, 2022). Climate projections suggest increases in temperature across Latin America by 2100 (medium confidence) and reduced precipitation and altered rainfall seasons are already impacting rainfed subsistence farming in the Dry Corridor in Central America (CDKN, 2014; Thomas et al., 2018). Global Climate and Earth System Models indicate that the region is projected to become distinctly drier in the future with rainfall changes ranging from between -22% to +7% by 2100 (CDKN, 2014). The region also faces increasing incidences of hurricanes and extreme rainfall events (Harvey et al., 2018; Pacillo et al., 2022). 

Smallholder coffee and maize and bean farmers are highly vulnerable to climate change as their crops are sensitive to rising temperatures and changing rainfall patterns (Harvey et al., 2018). Rising temperatures, decreases in annual rainfall and drought conditions have negative impacts on the biomass production, flowering and yields of maize and beans. It is projected that by 2025, bean production in Central America could be reduced by more than 20%. Nicaragua and Honduras, the main bean-producing countries, can expect yield losses of 14%. El Salvador will suffer a reduction of 7%, but Guatemala might increase its overall production because of its highlands. In Honduras, El Salvador and Nicaragua, and in poor soil simulations, maize yields are expected to decline by more than 15% by 2025 (Harvey et al., 2018). Furthermore, flowering in coffee plantations is triggered by the first rains but if the season becomes too dry or too wet the coffee flowers and fruits may dehisce or not grow to full size. Higher ambient temperatures speed up the ripening of coffee berries, contributing to poorer produce quality (Imbach et al., 2017). Climate change is likely to alter the areas suitable for smallholder coffee and maize and bean production across the region (Gourdji et al., 2015; Harvey et al., 2018; Imbach et al., 2017). Although, Mexico may preserve some optimal and medium suitability areas. While pest and disease control are not a new concern for farmers, changing precipitation patterns and increasing average temperatures are worsening the issue by altering the distribution, population dynamics and frequency of incidence, this is evident in outbreaks of fall armyworm and diseases such as tar spot complex in maize and leaf rust in coffee (Eash et al., 2019; Harvey et al., 2018). 

Smallholder farmers in the maize and bean agricultural system are particularly vulnerable to climate change hazards due to widespread poverty, weak land tenure, poor infrastructure, a general lack of access to inputs, finance and extension support, and low levels of education.  These vulnerabilities are further compounded by a high prevalence of degraded soils and high rates of deforestation, as farmers intensify and expand their agricultural production to adapt to climate-induced yield reductions (Gourdji et al., 2015; Waddick, 2017).

Climate change is already having significant adverse impacts on smallholder coffee and maize and bean farmers across the region and could undermine national and regional efforts to alleviate poverty, achieve food security, and enhance economic development. Facilitating smallholder farmer adaptation to climate change will require a combination of policy, technical and research solutions, improved access to extension services and climate information, and the creation of incentives, credit, and other financing mechanisms to support farmer adaptation efforts (Harvey et al., 2018)."
"Dryland mixed (MENA)","Climate change threatens the viability of agriculture, ecosystems and rural livelihoods in the Middle East and North Africa region. The region is the most water-stressed in the world (Govind, 2022). Droughts have become more frequent and intense and are considered the region’s most significant climate hazard (Dixon et al., 2001; OECD/FAO, 2018; Hyman et al., 2016; IPCC, 2022; Jobbins and Henley, 2015). The dryland mixed system has a Potential Drought Impact Index of 104,013, with Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia increasingly recognised as global drought hotspots (Hyman et al., 2016; Jobbins and Henley, 2015). Dryland mixed agriculture is practised in the coastal areas of Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria and Libya which are vulnerable to sea level rise. Furthermore, projections indicate an increase in aridity, with the Levant and North African coastlines likely to become 20% drier (Jobbins and Henley, 2015).
Regional projections of extreme precipitation events are inconsistent (Govind, 2022; Jobbins and Henley, 2015). However, there is a significant trend of declining annual precipitation in Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Jordan and Syria (Govind, 2022). As the rainfed agricultural system is vulnerable to reduced precipitation, it is projected that the demand for irrigation will increase, and some areas will revert to rangeland (OECD/FAO, 2018). Heat waves in the Middle East and North Africa region will be more frequent and intense by 2030 and will continue to increase to 2100 (Jobbins and Henley, 2015). Summer temperatures are expected to increase by 1˚C to 1.5˚C across the region with increases of up to 2˚C in some parts of Iran, Iraq and Algeria. These trends are likely to intensify into the future with increases of up to 3˚C across the region by 2065 (Govind, 2022; Hyman et al., 2016; Jobbins and Henley, 2015).
Regional agricultural production is already impacted by the changing climate, as well as system vulnerabilities such as a high prevalence of degraded land due to wind and water erosion, a loss of biodiversity and unsustainable farming practices. Further increases in temperature and reduced precipitation will cause a decline in rainfed crop yields which already have below average productivity (OECD/FAO, 2018). By 2100, it is projected that total agricultural production in the region could decrease by up to 21% (2000 baseline). Wheat yields in Tunisia have already declined as higher temperatures have shortened the growing season by ten days (Jobbins and Henley, 2015). Furthermore, farmed soils are severely degraded in the region, resulting in declines in productivity of 30%- 35% of their potential (OECD/FAO, 2018).  Climate change also affects the types and severity of pests and diseases in the region, which negatively impacts agricultural productivity, for example, a 2˚C increase in average global surface temperatures is projected to cause wheat yield losses of 46% (Durrell, 2018). Extreme events such as droughts and floods result in outbreaks of pests, and prolonged leaf wetness increases the likelihood of diseases. Higher temperatures and shifting rainfall patterns lead to the spread of vector-borne diseases, ticks, and macro-parasites, as well as the emergence of new diseases in livestock (Durrell, 2018). 
Agriculture (both crops and livestock) is a critical source of employment in the region. Smallholder farmers in remote areas of the dryland mixed agricultural system are particularly vulnerable to increasing climate hazards and are at risk of chronic poverty (Govind, 2022; Jobbins and Henley, 2015). The adaptive capacity of smallholder farmers is affected by limited access to improved crops and varieties, poor access to markets and services and few opportunities for off-farm income (Dixon et al., 2001; Jobbins and Henley, 2015). These challenges are compounded by regional post-war geopolitical complexities (OECD/FAO, 2018; Govind, 2022).
Climate change has influenced migration patterns in the region and displacement is expected to increase as conditions become hotter and drier. By 2015, over six million refugees worldwide originated in the Middle East and North Africa (4.9 million from Syria alone), and the region accounted for 40% of the world’s Internally Displaced People (Durrell, 2018).
Key climate change adaptation options for the dryland mixed system include the adoption of drought tolerant crop varieties, conservation agriculture practices, wind erosion control through windbreaks, water harvesting and storage, crop stubble mulch, optimised cropping systems, integrated farming systems and the farming of improved livestock breeds combined with good animal management practices (Govind, 2022; Devkota et al., 2022; Mohamed et al., 2019). 
There is scope for poverty reduction through improved access to off-farm income generation and better regulatory measures to secure smallholder farmers’ access to land, water and technology (Dixon et al., 2001). Furthermore, extension services need to improve dryland farmers’ access to improved crop varieties, build their capacities in conservation agriculture practices, reinstall traditional water management techniques, and promote intercropping and the application of appropriate technologies (Dixon et al., 2001).
Current policy encourages the modernisation of agriculture, involving the promotion of large intensively cultivated private farms. Small farms are typically excluded from policy and subsequently do not benefit from public support or bank loans, thereby restricting their access to modern technologies and improved practices (OECD/FAO, 2018). There is a need for policy reform that supports smallholder farmers.
Regional climate change research is lacking, but can be improved through institutional collaboration, network development, database building and capacity development (Govind, 2022). The evidence generated needs to inform policy and institutional reforms for climate-smart reconstruction, resilience and stabilisation. There is potential to reduce conflict in the region by strengthening institutions, improving natural resource management and reducing land degradation induced by climate change (Govind, 2022). Focus is also needed on supporting frameworks for successful water management and seed governance. Research and development need to be participatory, involving smallholder farmers and women in particular. On-farm research on crop-livestock integration, resource conservation and system sustainability will be key."
"Highland Mixed (MENA)","The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) is one of the regions that will be most affected by the impacts of climate change. Small-scale farmers are amongst the most vulnerable communities to these impacts because of their direct dependence on climate and natural resources, relative poverty, and often poor access to support systems and safety nets (Lewis et al., 2018)

The main agricultural value chain commodities in the highland mixed farming system include cereals (Wheat, rice and corn), legumes (Beans, lentils and chickpeas) and livestock (mostly sheep and goat). Highland mixed farming systems are more vulnerable to flooding and the associated soil erosion that can further reduce crop yields. Livestock are also likely to deliver reduced dairy milk yield relative to feed. This is mostly for goats and sheep, which constitute the majority of ruminants. This jeopardizes the income of the farmers in the lands  where these systems prevail (FAO, 2015). Other major climatic hazards impacting on crops and livestock in the farming system include increase in extreme rainfall, increase in average temperatures, increase in drought, strong winds and rising sea level (ESCWA et al. 2017; Lewis et al., 2018;  Dixon et al., 2020). The impacts felt as a result of the mentioned hazards are devastating and include soil erosion, reduced water quality, water scarcity, land degradation, reduced crop productivity/failure, reduced ground water table, unpredictable planting period and desertification among many other impacts. Socioeconomic impacts include increase in food imports, increase in migration, lack of willingness to invest in sustainable agricultural practices and loss of income. The factors that make the agricultural communities in the farming system more vulnerable include  unsustainable natural resource use, high poverty levels, unsustainable land management practices and reliance on rainfed agriculture (Dixon et al., 2001; ESCWA et al. 2017; Namdar et al., 2021)

There are several opportunities to address climate change for small-scale agriculture in the highland mixed farming system. They include reinforcing on-farm capacity (both to enhance labour and agricultural productivity) and assets such as irrigation infrastructure and soil and water conservation inputs, diversifying on farm and off farm activities such as investing in post harvest technologies, developing social protection systems that enhance resilience, and managing the non-climate stressors at the technical and policy levels (Namdar et al., 2021; Garitty et al., 2012, Dixon et al., 2020)

In some cases, the option of moving out of agriculture, or radically changing the production system, will also need to be considered. In addition to the direct risks for small-scale farmers, the limits to their productivity and production in the context of climate change have broader implications for the investment decisions of governments or the private sector to ensure national food security. In evaluating the different policy and investment opportunities, governments will need to consider the implications that these policies will have for small-scale farmers and their livelihoods, as well as for the national food security strategies (Namdar et al., 2021)"
"Rainfed mixed (MENA)","The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region emerges as one of the hot spots for worsening extreme heat, drought and aridity conditions under climate change. A synthesis of peer-reviewed literature from 2010 to date and own modeling work on biophysical impacts of climate change on selected sectors shows that the region is highly affected by present and future climate change. These biophysical impacts paired with other pressures and a lack of resilience in some countries cause high vulnerabilities within these sectors and for social dimensions in the MENA region (Waha et al., 2017). The agricultural sector, of which 70 percent is rain-fed, is highly exposed to changing climatic conditions. This is of critical importance as the agriculture sector is the largest employer in many Arab countries and contributes significantly to national economies (Waha et al., 2017).

In the more humid areas, tree crops (olives, fruits and nuts) are an important component and may dominate the system. They may be intercropped with cereals and vegetables while the trees are immature, but when mature they may become a monoculture. Wheat, barley, lentils, chickpeas, potatoes, sugarbeet and faba beans are the main annual crops. Summer crops are grown following a winter fallow. Vegetables, oil crops and flowers may also be grown, often with protection (polythene tunnels) in order to access specialised markets in Northern Europe and elsewhere (Dixon et al., 2001).

The climatic hazards impacting on agricultural production in the rainfed mixed farming include increase in average temperatures, increase in drought events, increase in tropicals / cyclones, rising sea levels, shorter growing season, increase in extreme heat, decrease in average precipitation, and increase in extreme rainfall events (ESCWA et al., 2017; Borghesi and Ticci, 2019; Mahmoud, 2021). Some of the major impacts of climate change on agricultural production in the system include,  soil erosion especially during rainstorms and erosion by wind on light, over-cultivated, exposed soils, change in production zone suitability where warmer and drier climate is projected to shift vegetation and agricultural zones northwards, shorter growing seasons due to lower rainfalls and higher temperatures , reduced crop and livestock productivity, reduced ground water table which is the major source of water in the agrisystem and desertification (Dixon et al. 2001, Evan, 2009; Ferrise et al. 2013, Waha et al., 2017)

The common factors that make communities in the agrisystem more vulnerable to effects of climate change than others include; demographic pressures on land and water resources with the trend being poor access to quality land faced by increasing numbers of small scale farmers, high poverty levels especially among the rural farmers, unequal opportunties for women, poor water use efficiency and management with consumption of water per capita being more than the global average (Dixon et al., 2001; Al-Riffai and Breisinger, 2012; Waha et al., 2017; ). Other factors that create an inability to cope with climate change are social unrest and political instability where little agriculutral activities and support occur in conflict prone areas, inconsistency in policy implementation and unstable commodity prices (Al-Riffai and Breisinger, 2012; Waha et al., 2017)

There are existing adaptation strategies that can be amplifed and at the same time new interventions can be adopted to support existing ones. Some of the major adaptation options that can be integrated in the agrisystem include;  Diversification of livelihoods, Implementing reforestation practices, investing in agriculture research and development, implementing efficient water management, adopting post harvest technologies and building womens capacity to take up leading roles in on farm and off farm activities (Al-Riffai and Breisinger, 2012; Srinivasarao et al., 2013, Verner, 2012)."
"Rainfed Mixed ","The rainfed mixed farming system in South Asia mostly lies in Central and South of India and a small part of Sri Lanka. The Main crops grown within the system include wheat, barley, vegetables and fodder crops in the cooler northern areas, while maize, sorghum, finger millet, vegetables, chickpea, pigeon pea, green gram, black gram and groundnuts are more common in the warmer climates of Southern India. Smaller areas of soybean, rapeseed, chilli, onions and sesame are grown mainly as cash crops (Dixon et al., 2001)

Double cropping is possible only where irrigation is available. In Southern India and the Dry Zone of Sri Lanka, where land holdings are smaller, farmers prefer to grow wetland rice on any irrigated land available, as well as in the poorly drained valley bottoms during the wet season. The above-mentioned coarse grains, pulses and oilseeds are grown on the upper parts of the landscape (Dixon et al., 2001)

The major climate change hazards impacting on the value chains in the farming system include flooding, tropical cyclones and drought that among other impacts lead to crop yield and livestock loss and damage to infrastructure (Mohanty & Wadhawan, 2021). While the total area covered by the system is larger than the Rice-Wheat Farming System, the heavy reliance on rainfed agriculture imposes a much lower population density - about half that of the latter system. A large proportion of the rural population in the Rainfed-Mixed Farming System live in chronic poverty, aggravated by periodic drought-induced severe transient poverty. Agriculture is oriented towards subsistence; while most areas are poorly served by infrastructure and services, and are remote from markets. Agricultural extension services in these areas are typically weak, farmers mostly use traditional technology with a strong bias towards risk avoidance. Land tenure is often an issue and farmers may not have sufficiently clear titles to their land to be able to use it as collateral for obtaining institutional credit . Farmers engaged in agricultural activities under 174 m ha of the Agri system are highly exposed to climatic hazards with the major risks being food insecurity and loss of livelihoods (Dixon et al., 2001)

There is need for more implementation of adaptation interventions and improving of existing strategies to prevent loss of livelihood to the local communities depending on agriculture as their main economic activity. Some of the existing adaptation options include implementing reforestation practices, investing in irrigation infrastrucutre, Investing in water harvesting and storage infrastructure, Investing in agricultural research and development, diversifying livelihoods, capacity building on sustainable agricultural practices, soil and water conservation practices and implementing agroforestry (Dixon et al., 2001;SNC, 2012;  ADB, 2017; GIZ, 2019; ). Other important adaptation options include developing policies for building climate change resilience, building climate information services and Improving access to risk insurance schemes (Swain, 2014; DST, 2020;  World Bank, 2021)."
"Rice-wheat (SA)","The rice-wheat agricultural system occupies approximately 15.8 million hectares of cultivable land in South Asia, mostly in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Nepal (Bhatt et al., 2016; Mishra et al., 2021). Rice and wheat are the principal calorie sources for over a billion people in the region, providing food security and livelihoods for the growing population. Over the past ten years, the rice-wheat system has seen a decline in productivity due to receding groundwater tables, soil degradation, frequent and widespread pest infestations and climate change (Bhatt et al., 2021).

The predominant climate hazard affecting the system is increasing average temperatures and an increase in extreme heat. It is projected that the annual average maximum temperature in South Asia will increase by 1.4–1.8 °C by 2030 and 2.1–2.6 °C by 2050, and thus, heat-stressed areas in the region could increase by 12% in 2030 and 21% in 2050 (Arshad et al., 2016; Aryal et al., 2019; Zacharias et al., 2014). Above-optimal temperatures directly harm the physiological processes of rice and wheat crops, reducing biomass production. Rice yields are projected to decline by 3.2%–22% with an increase in air temperature of 1- 4˚C by 2100 and almost half of the Indo-Gangetic Plain, the major food basket of the South Asian region, may become unsuitable for wheat production by 2050 due to heat stress (Aryal et al., 2019).

Another climate hazard of concern is increasingly erratic rainfall which also reduces crop yields. Rainfall variability is one of the main reasons for low crop yields in Nepal (Aryal et al., 2019; Mishra et al., 2021). Higher temperatures and changes to precipitation are exacerbating the spread of insects, pests and diseases contributing to a loss in crop yields. New insect species (resistant to insecticides) have appeared over the last few decades (Arshad et al., 2016; Bhatt et al., 2016; Venus et al., 2022). Further, invasive plant species are already problematic in the agricultural system, reducing crop productivity by competing for light, water and nutrients.
Traditional crop management practices are unsustainable, for example, wet tillage has led to the structural degradation of soils and the burning of rice residues has depleted soil nutrients (Bhatt et al., 2016; Bijarniya, 2020; Mishra et al., 2021). Further, water use efficiency is low in the agricultural system with approximately 35% to 55% of irrigation water lost before reaching the fields (Bhatt et al., 2016). Groundwater levels are declining as the number of private tubewells have increased significantly and water use regulation is insufficient (Bhatt et al., 2021; Dixon et al., 2001; Mishra et al., 2021).  Higher transpiration rates due to increasing average temperatures and extreme hot days are expected to exacerbate water scarcity in the region.

Poverty and food insecurity are widespread in South Asia, affecting mainly landless agricultural workers and sharecroppers, and is expected to worsen as rice and wheat yields decline further (Dixon et al., 2001). Key adaptation options to enhance the resilience of rice-wheat farmers and improve crop yields include wider adoption of conservation agriculture and climate-smart agricultural practices. There is a need for building the capacity of extension agents on these sustainable land management practices to increase adoption (Pokharel et al., 2018). Integrated research approaches are needed to measure the components of local and regional water balance and quantify regional hydrology outcomes over a large temporal scale. This will allow for the development of appropriate water management policy (Mojid & Mainuddin, 2021). Moving away from rice production to less water demanding crops such as cotton, maize or legumes in the summer could also improve the water productivity of the agricultural system."
"Rice (SA)","Climate hazards such as increasing temperatures, changes in precipitation patterns, increase in pests and diseases, sea level rise and the occurrence of extreme events such as flooding and tropical cyclones adversely impact rice agricultural systems in South Asia. Under current scenarios, rice production is projected to fall by 8% by the year 2050 (World Bank, 2021). An increase in temperature of 2.5˚C during the vegetative and reproductive stages of rice can reduce yields by 23% and 27% respectively (Bera and Sarkar, 2021; Mohanty et al., 2013). Under a scenario of a 2.5˚C to 4.9˚C temperature rise, rice yields are projected to drop by 32%-40% in India and studies already indicate a decline in the productivity of the summer rice crop (Aus) in Bangladesh (Mainuddin et al., 2022).

Drought is considered the most significant constraint to rice production in the region as the crop requires large amounts of water. Drought stress is very damaging during the reproductive stages, it also reduces leaf area, photosynthetic rate, above ground biomass and accelerates leaf senescence contributing to lower yields. Around 60% of the land used for rice production in Bangladesh is projected to be affected by seasonal drought by 2030, with a similar percentage in yield reduction, and an increase in drought frequency in India has caused a rice yield reduction of 1.7% (Rahman et al., 2019).

Flooding due to heavy rainfall and river overflow has impacted negatively on the rice agricultural system in Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and India. Although a semiaquatic plant, rice is generally intolerant of complete submergence and plants die within a few days when completely submerged. As rice crops tend to be in an active stage of development when flooding occurs and farmers have already made large investments in inputs, the degree of damage is often serious and irreparable. Furthermore, farmers then miss the growing season as flooded fields cannot be used immediately. For example, in Bangladesh, flooding is likely to cause a decline in rice production by 8%–17% by 2050 (Rahman et al., 2019).

The rice agricultural system is vulnerable to water scarcity, which is exacerbated by increasing competition with other sectors. An increase in groundwater extraction to meet growing food demands is leading to a depletion of groundwater tables. This increases the cost of irrigation due to the need to install expensive deep tube-wells (Alam et al., 2021). For example, in Bangladesh, the area under Boro rice production has grown considerably over the past 30-40 years leading to a decline in groundwater levels and an eventual scarcity of dry season irrigation water (Mainuddin et al., 2022). Subsequently, the Government has restricted the installation of new irrigation wells and is vigorously advocating crop diversification by replacing high water-demanding rice with low water-demanding crops.

The productivity and sustainability of the rice agricultural system is also threatened by declining soil fertility. Tillage intensive rice cropping practices have deteriorated the physical quality of soils and decreased soil organic carbon levels. Long-term wet tillage affects soil aggregation and microorganism activity, requires more water and emits substantial amounts of methane. The use of agro-chemicals has resulted in a growth in rice production but at the cost of soil health. This is exacerbated by a lack of crop diversification.

Conservation and climate-smart agriculture practices are recommended to improve the productivity and sustainability of the rice agricultural system in the face of climate change. Key conservation agriculture practices include crop rotation, reduced/no tillage and mulching and crop residue retention. Commonly recommended climate-smart agriculture practices include the use of high-yielding and stress-tolerant varieties, the adoption of improved water management technologies, alternate wetting and drying and direct seeded rice.

Population growth and competition for land with industrialisation and urbanisation has led to a decline in farm size for rice cultivation, thereby limiting the scope for horizontal expansion for increased food production and reducing the capacity of rice producers to adapt to climate change. This further highlights the need for sustainable land management practices that increase rice yields (Poonam et al., 2018). Government regulations and mechanisms are necessary to enhance farmers’ productivity via capacity building (Suresh et al., 2021). Rice is a main contributor to the economies of Sri Lanka, India and Bangladesh and yield losses due to climate change are expected to have major impacts on the food security and livelihoods of rice producing communities. "
"Agropastoral","

 Climate change impacts on the agropastoral system in various ways. Climate projections indicate an increase in erratic rainfall with unpredictable onset and cessation of rainfall. Extreme droughts and increasing temperatures are also expected to increase.
These climatic risks affect crop and livestock productivity of the system.  For example, increased temperatures are expected to decrease yields of maize, millet and sorghum are projected, while yields of cassava, cow peas, groundnuts and rice (Filho et al., 2020; Thornton et al., 2009; Herrero et al., 2016). In some parts, increased precipitation and temperature will increase the prevalence of vector-borne diseases such as Rift Valley Fever and malaria (Fall A. pers. comms., 2022) and pests such as locust (Herrero et al., 2016). Drought majorly impacts on livestock production through reduced availability and quality of forage, water scarcity leading to a drop in productivity, increased susceptibility to pests and diseases, and potentially high herd mortality (Thornton et al., 2009; Herrero et al., 2016).  The system is also exposed to a number of vulnerabilities including conflict for resources, weak land tenure, low market access, small land sizes and high illiteracy rates (Dixon et al., 2020). 

Livestock mobility in search of grazing areas and water is a common adaptation practice in the system. conflict over resources (Stavi et al., 2021; Dixon et al., 2020; Hughes, 2014; Tremblay, 2016; Zougmore et al., 2016; Kabede et al., 2021; Kirby, 2022; Ayantunde at al., 2011). Climate change adaptation measure sustainable the agropastoral system include technological improvement in soil and water conservation techniques, agroforestry, improved seeds, targeted fertilization, improved market access and livelihood diversification (Dixon et al., 2020).
"
"Cereal-root crop mixed (SSA)","The cereal-root crop mixed farming system in Sub Saharan Africa has for some time been considered one of the future bread baskets of Africa. The  farming system has the most suitable climate  compared to other systems in Africa for tropical cereals such as maize, sorghum and millet. Despite the suitable agroecological conditions, 55 per cent of the population subsists on less than US$1.99 per day. This is mainly attributed to high present-day temperatures and reliance on rainfed agriculture which has made the system highly vulnerable to climate change. Some of the main hazards that the system faces are: increase in average temperatures, drought events, cyclones, rainfalls and rising sea levels (World Bank, 2021; UN, 2020).These climatical conditions result in both biophysical and socio-economic impacts. For example, increasing temperatures and declining rainfall have led to large parts of Sub-Saharan Africa becoming unsuitable for multiple staple crops, which may necessitate a transition to more heat and drought resistant crops to ensure food and nutrition security. Soybean  for example is relatively resilient to temperature increases, however maize and cassava are not, leading to declines in crop suitability (FAO, 2022).  
Some of the biophysical impacts of climate related hazard in the system include: soil erosion, landslide events, flash floods, damage to infrastructure,reduced crop productivity, land degradation, siltation, shift in growing seasons and delays in transportation (World Bank, 2021; V. Bjornlund et al.,2020; R.Peter et al., 2017; S.Zingore et al., 2015 and C. Jabara et al., 2009). Climate change variabiliby also leads to socio-economic  factors such as: loss of income, increase in food insecurity, increase  in poverty, food spoilage, increase food prices and malnutrition (V Bjornlund et al., 2022; N. S. Emife and O. Emeka ,2020; IMF,2021; Peyton Fleming, 2019; X. Fang et al.,2020). While overall the farming system has been able to meet food requirements, a significant proportion of the population is undernourished and experiences food shortages during the hungry period (Amir Kassam et al., 2022). This is partly because agricultural yields, particularly maize, are low compared to other major producers. Increased food production will require focused investments by governments and the private sector. 
The farming system is highly vulnerable to poverty, crop susceptibility to pest and diseases, and over-reliance on rainfed agriculture (FAO, 2022; EH Atake et al.,2018; B Shiferaw et al., 2014). In addition, there are institutional vulnerabilities such as inability to interpret climate information and issues such as low access to markets and unstable commodity prices (S Coulibaly et al., 2022 ; T Alemu et al., 2011). Moreover, there exist vulnerabilities related to high prevalence of land degradation caused by multiple forces, such as human activities that pollute or degrade the quality of soils (FAO,2021).                    
Many adaptation and mitigation strategies can help address climate change, but no single option is sufficient by itself. To cope with impacts already locked into the farming system, there is a need to develop and scale adaptation strategies such as; reforestation practices, investing in irrigation infrastructure, investing in research and development, creation of climate change awareness, diversification of livelihoods and implementing climate smart agricultural practices (Amir Kassam et al., 2022; Issah Sugri et al., 2021; D. Princess Akinyi et al.,2021; E. Jackson et al., 2017). The small scale producers especially in the rural areas needs to be included in the implementation of these adaptation and mitigation strategies. There is a need for financial and market inclusion (M Carranza et al., 2019 and S Coulibaly et al., 2022).
"
"Highland temperate mixed","In Africa, agricultural productivity growth has been reduced by 34% since 1961 due to climate change, more than any other region (IPCC, 2022). The highland mixed farming system in particular, has yield gaps, despite its relatively well-endowed water and land resources. 70 to 96 per cent of farming system in the various countries depends on traditional farming practices and  is faced by limited inputs resources (Dixon et al., 2020). The system productivity is vulnerable to both climatic and non-climatic factors.  
Increasing seasonal rainfall variability has affected predictions on rainfall onset and cessation and this is changing the farm management strategies and operations (UNFCCC,2020; Dixon et al., 2020). The short rains which used to produce 30 per cent of the food and 40 per cent of the feed have repeatedly failed in most countries. Farmers are shifting towards short-maturing varieties, and some crop species which used to grow in warmer climates are now grown in the mountains (Dixon et al., 2020). Rainfall variability is also affecting water availability in reservoirs that used to satisfy irrigation needs and livestock drinking downstream.  
Extreme rainfall events due to climate change are also predicted to cause flash floods and storms that could destroy infrastructure downstream, cause soil erosion and damages on crops. The negative impacts results to poor agricultural yields, food insecurity, conflicts and urban migration (Dixon et al., 2020,WMO,2020). 
On the other hand, temperature increase of 2–3°C could cause higher prevalence of pests and diseases in the highland including increasing malaria incidences ((Alemayehu and Bewket, 2016). However, the livestock-cereal subsystem is likely to achieve positive impacts in crop yields and pasture productivity if precipitation and higher temperature continues to rise (Tesfaye et al. 2016; Dixon et al., 2020).
 The effects of climate change on the system are aggravated by other non-climatic factors including poor market infrastructure, low coping strategies and weak institutional and policy environment and limited access to human and financial capital (Dixon et al., 2020). Enhancing system adaptation strategies would require more investments in improved infrastructure, land restoration, market oriented strategies and diversification of livelihoods (Echeverría et al. 2016; Dixon et al., 2020).  "
"Highland Perennial","Climate change is already altering the production of tea and coffee in the highland perennial system. Increase in temperatures and extreme rainfall events are affecting the growing conditions for tea and arabica coffee in most regions.
As a result, the biophysical impacts of climate change are more pronounced in this system. For instance, the length of dry seasons per year and occurrence of hailstorms and frost is expected to increase (Muoki et al, 2020; MoALFC and World Bank 2021; Cheserek et al., 2015).  Both tea and arabica coffee are sensitive to water availability and extreme temperature, with temperatures restricting shoot growth rates in tea and disrupted flowering in coffee (Rigden et al., 2020; Bongase ED, 2017; Lemma and Megersa, 2021). Frost leads to leaf scorching (Muoki et al, 2020; Kamunya S. pers. comms., 2022) and is increasingly affecting production in the highlands.  
Potential adaptation strategies include moving Kenya’s tea and coffee production to higher altitudes, but the amount of suitable land is limited and the risk of environmental destruction is high (Ridley 2010);(Muoki et al., 2020); (Cheserek et al., 2015); (USAID, 2017); (FAO, 2015); (Kamunya S. pers. comms., 2022);(CIAT, 2011);(Lemma and Megersa, 2021);(Davis et al., 2012). Therefore, continued production is pegged on other strategies such as adopting tea varieties with higher optimal temperature thresholds and improved ability to access soil moisture through greater rooting depths (Rigden et al., 2020). Other strategies include pest resistant varieties, adoption of water efficient irrigation technologies, promotion of shade trees and diversification of livelihoods (Rigden et al., 2020; Lemma and Megersa, 2021; Kamunya S. pers. comms., 2022; Cheserek et al., 2015).
 Responding to climate risks is the highland perennial farming system is critical becauseof it's large contribution to the economy and food security of East African countriesIn most countries(Dixon et al., 2020; UNFCCC, 2020). For instance, tea in Kenya and coffee in Ethiopia are leading export commodities and the industries employ around 10% of the population (Rigden et al., 2020; FAO, 2015). "
"Mixed Maize","Agriculture in southern Africa is difficult due to climate variability and climate extremes,
climate change is expected to magnify these challenges. In Zambia, maize is a popular crop that is crucial for calorie and protein intake and is grown by many farmers on large amounts of land (Verhage et al., 2018).  Projected temperature increases, more extreme weather, and uncertain rainfall are likely to result in crop losses, crop failures and increased outbreaks of pests and diseases.  Agriculture in eastern Zambia will mainly be affected by increased rainfall variability, while the western part of the country will face higher temperatures as well as water and temperature variability challenges. 

Means of adaptation vary according to the key climate risk, for example, adequate access to water may be addressed via improved water use efficiency and water management and temperature related risks could be addressed by adopting heat tolerant maize varieties or different heat/drought tolerant crops altogether e.g. sorghum and millet. Other means of adaptation include improved climate and agricultural advisory services and better access to agricultural risk insurance and credit (Verhage et al., 2018). 

Small-scale farmers are particularly vulnerable to changes in the climate as they rely on rainfed agriculture for their livelihoods. Furthermore, as maize is a staple crop in Zambia, these negative climate change impacts will affect food systems in the region by reducing food availability, creating local production shortfalls and thereby contribute to rising commodity prices (Verhage et al., 2018).

"Pastoral","Leah pls note this was written for agropastoral in Senegal

Climate projections for Senegal indicate that temperatures will continue to increase by 1.1 to 1.8 °C by 2035, and up to 3 °C by the 2060s. Rainfall projections are less certain, with high rainfall events expected to occur but rainfall will be less frequent, leading to an increase in dry spells and prolonged drought (CIAT and BFS/USAID, 2016). 

Agriculture comprises 7.1% of Senegal's GDP and employs about 70% of the population. The sector is highly susceptible to climate change as only 7% of cultivated land is irrigated (CCAFS, n.d.). This is evident in the peanut industry where productivity has declined due to poor soil conditions and climatic factors (CIAT and BFS/USAID, 2016). Crop models show that groundnut yields may decrease by 5–25%, and maize and rainfed rice yields may gain by 5–25%. Cowpeas and cassava have a strong resistance to drought and high temperatures and can be cultivated on poor soils, which offers an adaptation opportunity for farmers located in the Groundnut Basin (CIAT and BFS/USAID, 2016).

Livestock is a key subsector, adopted by nearly 60% of farming households and accounts for 4.6% of GDP (Sow et al., 2021). For both crop farmers and pastoralists, livestock serve as a productive asset to generate income, and form a key component in food security strategies (Zougmoré et al., 2016). Drought has a major impact on livestock production through reduced availability and quality of forage, water scarcity leading to a drop in productivity, increased susceptibility to pests and diseases, and potentially high herd mortality. Pastoralists rely on moving their cattle in search of grazing areas and water every year which can result in conflict over resources (Zougmoré et al., 2016). 

Examples of adaptation options for agro-pastoralism in Senegal include a shift to small ruminants, livestock mobility to semiarid/subhumid zones, better integration of crop and livestock farming such as manure composting, growing of adapted crop varieties, e.g., drought-tolerant millet, cowpeas and cassava, use of fodder banks, use of water conservation technologies for irrigation and storage, and conservation agriculture practices (CIAT and USAID, 2016; Zougmoré et al., 2016).

"Root Crop","Root and tuber crops (cassava, yam and cocoyam) constitute a major part of the rural Ghanaian staple diet, accounting for 58% of the per capita food consumption (Sagoe, 2006). Root and tuber crops are also valuable to the country’s economy, employing around 70% of the population and contributing to 40% of agricultural gross domestic product (Osei-Adu et al., 2016; GEPA, 2017).

Root and tuber crop yields have a varied response to climate change dependent on the cultivar, soil type and status and prevalence of pests and diseases. Predominant abiotic stress factors include drought, water logging, temperature extremes and soil nutrient imbalances. Climate change scenarios project an increase in both the minimum and maximum temperatures for Ghana, and a decrease in rainfall which has negative implications for crop yields which are positively correlated to total rainfall (R=89 – 92%) and to a lesser extent, mean daily temperature (R <50%). For example, cassava yields are expected to reduce by 3%, 13.5% and 53% in 2020, 2050 and 2080, respectively (Sagoe, 2006).

Adaptation options include planting more than two varieties of root crops with different maturity periods, planting improved varieties that are nutrient efficient, drought tolerant and pest and disease resistent, adopting soil and water conservation practices, adjustment of planting dates and improved storage facilities to reduce post-harvest losses, amongst others (Acheampong et al., 2021; Adjei-Nsiah et al., 2019; Chemura et al., 2020; Sagoe, 2006). At the national scale, policy reform encouraging the production of multiple crops through market incentives and shifting extension advice to the production of multiple crops could enhance resilience (Chemura et al., 2020). 

Small-scale farmers in Ghana currently have limited capacity to adapt to climate change  and  root and tuber crops provide them with a staple food and primary income source (Owusu et al., 2020; Sagoe, 2006;Kumar et al., 2012)). This means that without adequate intervention climate change is likely to result in a loss of livelihoods, contributing to poverty and undernutrition."
