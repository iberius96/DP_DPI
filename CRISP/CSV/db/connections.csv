"Lowland Rice",EAP,"Increase in drought events","Leads to","Soil salinisation"," Severe drought years such as 1977–1978, 1997–1998, 2015–2016 and 2019–2020 are all related to El Niño events, which greatly affect production. During low river flow periods in Mekong Delta, between March and April, saline water intrudes up to 40–50 km inland from estuaries through main river systems  and about 100,000 ha of rice annually is at high risk of dry-season salinity intrusion. "
"Lowland Rice",EAP,"Rising sea levels","Leads to","Soil salinisation"," The risks of increasing saline intrusion and permanent inundation due to sea level rise, will significantly reduce the land suitable for rice cultivation in the Mekong delta by 50 % by 2050"
"Lowland Rice",EAP,"Increase in average precipitation","Leads to","Increased flooding
","Seasonal river flooding, which coincides with the rainy season that runs from May to November, plays a critical role in the health of the Mekong river system. These floods deposit sediments, which improve soil fertility, flush out polluted waters, and recharge the groundwater tables. However, excessive flooding during the rainy season are becoming more frequent, and structural elements are not expected to hold up under an increasingly severe climate regime, which is driving sea-level rise (SLR) and changing meteorological and hydrological conditions.Changes in climate are also causing flooding and drought in Lao PDR "
"Lowland Rice",EAP,"Increase in average precipitation","Leads to","Siltation/sedimentation of rivers","Floods deposit sediments downstream in the rice fields. The floods  improve soil fertility, flush out polluted waters, and recharge the groundwater tables."
"Lowland Rice",EAP,"Decrease in average precipitation","Leads to","Reduced crop productivity/failure","  Rainfall is greatly reduced in the Mekong and Red River deltas in the dry season. The annual rainy season tends to start late and to end early, resulting in a decrease in rainfall and runoff.  Reduced rainfall causes thousands of hectares of rice in the spring crop to suffer from drought or from reduction in irrigation water every year."
"Lowland Rice",EAP,"Decrease in average precipitation","Leads to","Water scarcity","The Mekong Delta is identified as water-risk “hotspots” that require a targeted policy response. These water risks are not only the result of precipitation changes but involve a range of factors, including farming practices, that cause water shortages, floods and degradation of water quality, extensive dam-building and ground water pumping."
"Lowland Rice",EAP,"Rising sea levels","Leads to","Reduced crop productivity/failure","A rise in the sea level of only 30 cm could see the loss of nearly 200,000hectares of rice cultivation. Vast tracks of land planted with rice are affected by salinity intrusion  causing reduved yield by  50-100%, or total loss. Sea level rise has adverse effect on the agricultural productivity especially in the deltas. "
"Lowland Rice",EAP,"Rising sea levels","Leads to","Change in production zone suitability","Weather extremes, flood patterns, and saline intrusion will change in all agro-ecological zones, but the changes vary from North to South, and from
coastal to inland areas, affecting the habitat suitability of rice and other major crops. Thiscould have drastic effects on crop distribution
in the future. The mainthreats for rice cultivation in the Deltas are relative sea level rise and increased saline intrusions."

"Lowland Rice",EAP,"Increase in drought events","Leads to","Water scarcity","The Lower Mekong Basin (LMB) has experienced some severe droughts in the past three decades and these droughts inflicted significant  harmful levels of salinity intrusion, and widespread shortage for domestic and industrial water use. Notably, droughts in 1991–1994 and 2015–2016 were the longest and driest droughts, respectively leading to water scarcity."
"Lowland Rice",EAP,"Rising sea levels","Leads to","Saline intrusion","Salt intrusion due to sea level rise has already caused agricultural productivity to decrease and rice production to decline. One particular severe salinity intrusion in 2016 affected 270,000 hectares of rice."
"Lowland Rice",EAP,"Decrease in average precipitation","Leads to","Shorter growing seasons","A simulation study showed that the start of the rice growing period (SGP) was delayed with reduced early rainfall during the 16-year period, leading to shorter growing seasons. The crop yield depends on rainfall distribution during growth, and the lack of irrigation water in the region makes this production system highly vulnerable to changes in precipitation."

areas, because of high salinity levels of the water causing unfavourable condition for rice production."
"Lowland Rice",EAP,"Saline intrusion","Leads to","Reduced crop productivity/failure","It was shown that seawater intrusion was the major factor leading to regional differences in rice cropping systems and land use patterns.

The use of biodegradable mulching materials protects the soil from direct rainfall impact and reduces evaporation.

If extreme heat stress is experienced during flowering, both rice and wheat experience decreased pollen viability and stigma deposition, leading to increased grain sterility. Wheat is more sensitive to heat stress than rice, with damage to the photosynthetic apparatus at temperatures >30˚C. Temperatures >33.7˚C at anthesis causes panicle sterility due to poor anther dehiscence and >34˚C during grain formation substantially reduces grain yields. Temperatures >35˚C (above optimal) during reproductive development affect flowering and grain formation in rice."

Drought is considered the most significant constraint to rice production in the region. Drought stress is very damaging to the rice crop during the reproductive stages, particularly during flowering, though drought at other stages can also result in significant yield losses.  Drought reduces rice leaf area, photosynthetic rate, above ground biomass and accelerates leaf senescence contributing to lower yields. Around 60% of the land used for rice production in Bangladesh is projected to be affected by seasonal drought by 2030, with a similar percentage in yield reduction.

Although a semiaquatic plant, rice is generally intolerant of complete submergence and plants die within a few days when completely submerged. As rice crops tend to be in an active stage of development and farmers have already made large investments in inputs, when flooding occurs the degree of damage is often serious and irreparable. Furthermore, farmers then miss the growing season as flooded fields cannot be used immediately. For example, in Bangladesh, flooding is likely to cause a decline in rice production by 8%–17% by 2050.
