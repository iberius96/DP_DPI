During low river flow periods in Mekong Delta, between March and April, saline water intrudes up to 40–50 km inland from estuaries through main river systems  and about 100,000 ha of rice annually is at high risk of dry-season salinity intrusion. "
"EAP_Lowland_Rice","Rising sea levels","Leads to","Soil salinisation"," The risks of increasing saline intrusion and permanent inundation due to sea level rise, will significantly reduce the land suitable for rice cultivation in the Mekong delta by 50 % by 2050"
"EAP_Lowland_Rice","Increase in average precipitation","Leads to","Increased flooding
","Seasonal river flooding, which coincides with the rainy season that runs from May to November, plays a critical role in the health of the Mekong river system. These floods deposit sediments, which improve soil fertility, flush out polluted waters, and recharge the groundwater tables. However, excessive flooding during the rainy season are becoming more frequent, and structural elements are not expected to hold up under an increasingly severe climate regime, which is driving sea-level rise (SLR) and changing meteorological and hydrological conditions.Changes in climate are also causing flooding and drought in Lao PDR "
"EAP_Lowland_Rice","Increase in average precipitation","Leads to","Siltation/sedimentation of rivers","Floods deposit sediments downstream in the rice fields. The floods  improve soil fertility, flush out polluted waters, and recharge the groundwater tables."
"EAP_Lowland_Rice","Decrease in average precipitation","Leads to","Reduced crop productivity/failure","  Rainfall is greatly reduced in the Mekong and Red River deltas in the dry season. The annual rainy season tends to start late and to end early, resulting in a decrease in rainfall and runoff.  Reduced rainfall causes thousands of hectares of rice in the spring crop to suffer from drought or from reduction in irrigation water every year."
"EAP_Lowland_Rice","Decrease in average precipitation","Leads to","Water scarcity","The Mekong Delta is identified as water-risk “hotspots” that require a targeted policy response. These water risks are not only the result of precipitation changes but involve a range of factors, including farming practices, that cause water shortages, floods and degradation of water quality, extensive dam-building and ground water pumping."
"EAP_Lowland_Rice","Rising sea levels","Leads to","Reduced crop productivity/failure","A rise in the sea level of only 30 cm could see the loss of nearly 200,000hectares of rice cultivation. Vast tracks of land planted with rice are affected by salinity intrusion  causing reduved yield by  50-100%, or total loss. Sea level rise has adverse effect on the agricultural productivity especially in the deltas. "
"EAP_Lowland_Rice","Rising sea levels","Leads to","Change in production zone suitability","Weather extremes, flood patterns, and saline intrusion will change in all agro-ecological zones, but the changes vary from North to South, and from
coastal to inland areas, affecting the habitat suitability of rice and other major crops. Thiscould have drastic effects on crop distribution
in the future. The mainthreats for rice cultivation in the Deltas are relative sea level rise and increased saline intrusions."

Notably, droughts in 1991–1994 and 2015–2016 were the longest and driest droughts, respectively leading to water scarcity."
" ","Rising sea levels","Leads to","Saline intrusion","Salt intrusion due to sea level rise has already caused agricultural productivity to decrease and rice production to decline. One particular severe salinity intrusion in 2016 affected 270,000 hectares of rice."
" ","Decrease in average precipitation","Leads to","Shorter growing seasons","A simulation study showed that the start of the rice growing period (SGP) was delayed with reduced early rainfall during the 16-year period, leading to shorter growing seasons. The crop yield depends on rainfall distribution during growth, and the lack of irrigation water in the region makes this production system highly vulnerable to changes in precipitation."
" ","Rising sea levels","Leads to","Coastal inundation","Dangers of sea-level rise include but are not limited to: land loss from the permanent inundation of low-lying coastal area."
" ","Increase in average temperatures","Leads to","Shorter growing seasons","Shifting seasons are directly linked to warmer global temperatures: a slight change in temperature brings an earlier spring thaw and delays and water stress."

Farmers are less likely to invest in modern technologies and practices if their land ownership is insecure and they are not guaranteed to reap the benefits of their efforts.

Silvopastoral systems provide shade, reducing body temperatures of grazing cattle by up to 4˚C compared with pasture-only systems. Some examples of climate smart pasture management options include not exceeding land carrying capacity, planting drought tolerant fodder crops (e.g. BRS Paiaguas), no tillage, intercropping of grasses and legumes for pasture diversification, and implementing manure management systems for improved soil quality."

"SA Rice","Increase in drought events","Leads to","Reduced crop productivity/failure","The rice agricultural system requires large supplies of water and is therefore susceptible to drought stress. Drought is considered the most significant constraint to rice production in the region. Drought stress is very damaging to the rice crop during the reproductive stages, particularly during flowering, though drought at other stages can also result in significant yield losses.  Drought reduces rice leaf area, photosynthetic rate, above ground biomass and accelerates leaf senescence contributing to lower yields. Around 60% of the land used for rice production in Bangladesh is projected to be affected by seasonal drought by 2030, with a similar percentage in yield reduction. An increase in drought frequency in India has caused a rice yield reduction of 1.7% and the drought of 2002 led to a 20% reduction in rice productivity. "

","Leads to","Reduced crop productivity/failure","Flooding from heavy rain and river overflow has impacted negatively on rice production in the region. Although a semiaquatic plant, rice is generally intolerant of complete submergence and plants die within a few days when completely submerged. As rice crops tend to be in an active stage of development and farmers have already made large investments in inputs, when flooding occurs the degree of damage is often serious and irreparable. Furthermore, farmers then miss the growing season as flooded fields cannot be used immediately. For example, in Bangladesh, flooding is likely to cause a decline in rice production by 8%–17% by 2050. In the early harvest period (April/May) floods frequently damage ripening rice in the Upper Meghna River Basin of Bangladesh. "
