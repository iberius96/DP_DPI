"Roland Rice",,"humid and moist subhumid ","197","71","52","33","825","474","197","Irrigated and rainfed","The lowland rice farming system is found in both humid and moist subhumid agro-ecological zones in well-watered mainly flat landscapes. Its the most populous system in the East Asia  and Pacific. It covers estimated 197 million ha with an agricultural population of 474 million. Cultivated area is 71 million ha, of which about 45 percent are irrigated. Large areas of this system are found in Thailand, Vietnam, Myanmar, South and Central East China, Philippines and Indonesia. Smaller areas are located in Cambodia, Korea DPR, Republic of Korea, Laos DPR and Malaysia (Dixon,et al., 2001;Cramb et al., 2015).
 The farming system is dominantly rice-based. Diversification includes field crops, vegetables,fruits, small livestock and aquaculture farming.  The cropping intensity in lowland farming system is dependent on rainfall distribution, length of growing season and the availability of supplementary irrigation(Dixon,et al., 2001;Cramb et al., 2015. In addition to rice farming livestock and off-farm income contribute to household livelihoods.
In many areas, the productivity of livestock within this farming system is low because of extensive management practices.Cattle and buffaloes are integrated into the systems, providing draught, dung, and occasional income (Cramb et al.,2015).However, there are opportunities to intensify small animal production enterprises in different regions.
The regional food security depends upon the production from this system. Poverty prevalence is moderate in most countries, although it is extensive in Mynamar and Cambodia (Dixon,et al., 2001).  Unemployment rate is above 40% in the region and the agriculture is an important income sector in all these countries.The productivity constraints for rice and non-rice crops are drought, flooding, saline instrusion,low soil fertility and inadequate production infrastructure (Dixon,et al., 2001; Cramb et al., 2015;CCAFS, 2016; Thuy Le Toan et al., 2021)).  Enhaced access to markets and the growing demand for non-rice crops and fodder has created opportunities for intensification and diversification in the region(Cramb et al., 2015).  Climate smart agriculture practices such as Alternate Wetting and Drying irrigation of rice fields are also measure being taken to address climate risks and vulnerabilities(Dixon,et al., 2001; Cramb et al., 2015; Akam & Gruere, 2018)."
"Temperate Mixed (EAP)",," Dry sub-humid","99"," "," "," "," "," ","0.3-1","rainfed,irrigated","Temperate mixed farming system is found in moist and dry sub-humid agroecological zones in Central-Northern China and restricted areas of Mongolia, with a total system area of 99 million ha. The transitional boundary between this system and the lowland rice farming System in central-eastern China is not easily defined, and the system also blends into the extensive cereal-livestock farming system of southern Siberia and parts of Central Asia. Major crops are wheat and maize, with smaller areas of rice, cotton, soybeans, sweet potato and rape, depending on local temperature and water conditions; as well as citrus and some temperate fruits. Livestock are also important, particularly cattle, pigs and poultry. The prevalence of poverty is moderate. The preferred staple food throughout the region is wheat noodles. There are two main sub-systems: the Loess Plateau Sub-System, involving mixed farming of both summer and winter crops; and the Northern Sub-System, in Northeast China, Korea DPR and restricted parts of Mongolia where the climate only permits cropping during the summer. Both are characterised by rainfall being concentrated in the summer months and by severe frosts in winter, particularly in the northern areas. Average farm size ranges from as little as 0.3 ha in the Loess Plateau of China to several hectares further north, where it gradually blends into the Pastoral Farming System. Average household size is approximately four to five persons.
In the Loess Plateau of China, wheat and rape are the main winter crops; while maize, rice, cotton, soybeans and sweet potato are the main summer crops. Cropping intensity is about 150 percent. Crops are grown under both irrigated and rainfed conditions. In the Northern Sub-System (Northeastern China, Korea DPR and Mongolia), because cropping is possible only during the summer, wheat (0.5 m ha in Korea DPR and Mongolia) and other cereals are grown concurrently and compete for cultivated land. Yields are lower in these zones due to adverse climatic conditions, and cereals may be supplemented by cold-resistant crops such as potatoes and cabbage. The higher yields in China are due to crops being grown with high organic and inorganic fertiliser inputs and intensive pest control practices. In this system, overall cropping intensity is high and scope for expansion of land area is limited. Livestock are also an important component of the system: particularly cattle for draught power, and pigs, small ruminants and poultry for meat.  Livestock are reared and managed under extensive conditions in most countries. More intensive production systems are found in China, however, especially for pigs and poultry (Dixon et al.,2001)

"Upland intensive mixed (EAP)",,"humid and subhumid ","314"," "," "," "," "," "," ","Rainfed","The upland intensive mixed agricultural system covers an area of 314 million ha in East Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is the most widespread and heterogenous farming system in the region (Dixon et al., 2001). The system is found in upland areas and hilly landscapes with moderate altitudes and moderate to steep slopes. The agro-ecological zones are classified as humid and subhumid (Dixon et al., 2001). 

The natural environment is fragile with steep slopes, high rainfall intensity, seasonal dry periods and shallow erodible soils of low fertility (Schreinemachers et al., 2013). Irrigation is uncommon, with less than 25% of the land irrigated (Dixon et al., 2001). To counter the steep gradients, simple terracing is used, although in some areas, such as the Philippines and Indonesia, the terracing is better developed. Soil and water conservation structures are typically absent (Dixon et al., 2001). 

The system comprises a wide range of largely permanent crops such as rice, pulses, sugarcane, oilseeds, maize, wheat, cotton, fruit and vegetables. Home gardens with vegetables and fruit trees are established for household consumption and extra income. The types of crops grown depends on the geographic location, agro-climatic zone, slope of the land and water availability. Livestock husbandry is an important component of the system, contributing draught power, meat, cash income and savings (Dixon et al., 2001). However, livestock production is generally low due to poor animal husbandry and animal health practices. Aquaculture is practiced in areas with water availability, mainly in combination with rice production (Dixon et al., 2001).

Farms within the system are typically remote with limited to no road infrastructure and poor access to goods and services. Rural credit and risk insurance is typically unavailable, rendering households vulnerable to natural disasters and crop failures. As farmers tend to operate semi-subsistence production systems, average incomes are low contributing to high poverty levels and food insecurity. Off-farm work is an important alternative income source. Currently, farmers are transitioning from rice-based subsistence cultivation to commercial market-oriented systems. For example, in Thailand and Vietnam, subsistence farmers growing upland rice with long fallow periods have adopted commercial farming systems and are using external inputs to intensively grow cash crops such as maize, vegetables, fruits and flowers (Schreinemachers et al., 2013). The movement is due to demographic pressure, improved access to global markets, land use policies, and is encouraged as a means of poverty alleviation (Hepp et al., 2019). "
"Coastal plantation and mixed farming (LAC)",," ","186"," "," "," "," "," "," ","rainfed","Coastal plantation and mixed farming in the Latin America and the Caribean covers 186 million ha. The system occupies some of the richest agricultural lands in the region, but also includes mangrove swamps and isolated areas of tropical forest. There are two major sub-systems: (a) small-scale family farms with mixed agriculture, in-shore fishing and frequent off-farm employment (e.g. tourism); and (b) large-scale plantations, typically export-oriented and often internationally owned, with intensive production and significant poverty among labourers. Otherwise, poverty is not prevalent (Dixon et al.; 2001)."
"Dryland Mixed (LAC)",,"Dry Moist sub-humid","127"," "," "," "," "," ","3.5","Rainfed","The Dryland Mixed Farming System includes two principal areas within Latin America: (i) the Northeast of Brazil, comprising about 20 percent of the country or 110 million ha; and (ii) the Yucatan peninsula of Mexico, extending into the Northern Peten zone of Guatemala, covering about 17 million ha. The annual precipitation in Northeast Brazil varies from 400 to 600 mm in the drier west of the Brazilian system, to 1000 mm in the East. In the Yucatan, the average range is 600 to 1500 mm. In both regions, soils are mainly shallow and stony with areas of low forest vegetation and elevations are low to moderate. Good quality agricultural land is scarce and there are few erosion control measures. Due to its location near the coast of Northeast Brazil and in the Yucatan peninsula of Mexico, the dryland mixed farming system of nearly 130 million ha has a well-established economic and productive structure, but faces severe moisture and soil quality constraints. Despite frequent droughts, irrigated agriculture is poorly developed; partly as a result of shortage of water availability, partly due to poor soil conditions, and partly because of investment requirements beyond the reach of most small producers. It is a system with extensive and severe poverty among small-scale producers, who exist alongside large-scale extensive ranches, and often depend on seasonal migration and wage labour for survival. Land degradation remains a serious problem (Dixon et al., 2001)."
"Forest based (LAC)",," ","600"," "," "," "," "," "," ","Rainfed","The forest based agricultural system is located in the Amazon basin, covering an area of over 600 million ha (Dixon et al., 2001). The agricultural system comprises indigenous communities and low-input agricultural activity that is interspersed with extensive beef and plantation farming in the peripheral areas of the Amazon region. Only a small portion of the forest based system is cultivated (<1%) and irrigation is scarce (Dixon et al., 2001). The population density is very low and poverty levels are low to moderate.

Indigenous communities of the Amazon region practice traditional shifting cultivation as well as agroforestry, where farmers rotate production amongst active fields of annual crops and regenerating forest areas, or fallows, to meet subsistence needs. Shifting cultivation, also known as swidden-fallow or slash-and-burn agriculture, is suited to the low soil fertility, high rainfall, and fast nutrient leaching that is characteristic of the area. Land is cleared by burning which adds nutrients to the soils, followed by the planting of crops such as acai, avocado and guava (USAID, 2018). After a few years of production, crops such as coffee, cacao, other fruit trees, rubber and Brazil nuts are grown. These crops are then harvested for many subsequent years before the cycle is repeated decades later (USAID, 2018). Shifting cultivation is commonly misunderstood as environmentally destructive and inefficient, but it is highly productive in terms of labour unit, product diversity, food security and the maintenance of biodiversity (Løvold, 2014). In shifting cultivation, the territory is collectively managed with plots under individual management, there is no individual ownership of plots. 

On the other hand, some farmers, particularly migrants, convert shifting cultivation systems to monoculture cropping, pasture, and plantations to intensify production. Such changes in land use tend to be motivated by changes in market conditions and land use policy as well as offers of credit and future profits by private firms or government agencies (Maeda et al., 2020; Ravikumar et al., 2016). Government policies typically stimulate agricultural commodities rather than promote sustainable forest-food systems (Løvold, 2014). 

Forest-based agriculture is undertaken at a variety of scales depending on the type of production. Small-scale crop production and family farming plots are predominant, ranging from 25 ha to 100 ha. However, medium-sized properties between 250 ha to 1,000 ha, and farms larger than 1,000 ha also occur (Maeda et al., 2020). Livestock production on extensive pastures and large-scale commodity agriculture are found on the bigger farms. The most common commodity crops in the Amazon region are soybean, maize, sorghum, and cotton. These farming systems are intensive, with two or more harvests a year, and are technologically advanced (Maeda et al., 2020). 

Deforestation for cattle ranching has been identified as a major threat to the Amazon biome and affects regional rainfall patterns. Clearing of land for large-scale cropping, such as of soybean in Brazil, is also a key contributor to deforestation. Deforestation of the Amazon region has global ramifications due to carbon emissions and biodiversity loss (Skidmore et al., 2021)."
"High Altitude Mixed (Central Andes)",,"Semiarid- dry subhumid ","121"," "," "," "," "," ","3","rainfed","The maize-beans agricultural system covers predominantly upland areas from the Panama Canal to the highland plateau of Guatemala and Central Mexico, extending over an area of approximately 65 million ha (Dixon et al., 2001). The elevation of the agricultural system typically ranges between 400 - 2,000 masl, but reaches 3,500 masl in the Guatemalan highlands. Annual precipitation varies from 1,000 mm to 2,000 mm (Dixon et al., 2001). Soils are of volcanic origin and relatively fertile, but the prevalence of soil degradation and erosion is high, particularly on steep gradients and cleared land. The system is characterised by high levels of deforestation, forested areas in Guatemala and Honduras steadily decreased between 1990 and 2015 and Nicaragua lost half of its forest cover in the last half-century (Gourdji et al., 2015; Waddick, 2017). The decrease (especially in Honduras) is attributed to agricultural expansion. 

Farms are typically small, less than two hectares in size. For example, in Guatemala, Costa Rica and Honduras, the average coffee production area is 1.41 ha, 0.92 ha for maize and 0.57 ha for beans (Harvey et al., 2018). Yields tend to be low, with rainfed maize averaging 1.5 t/ha and beans 0.7 t/ha (Dixon et al., 2001; Eitzinger et al., 2012).

Maize and beans form a vital component of the diets and culture of the agricultural system's population and smallholder farmers are key contributors to the national output of these crops. On-farm consumption is high, as noted by Harvey et al. (2018) who determined that less than a quarter of smallholder farmers sell their produce. Poverty is prevalent throughout the agricultural system (>30% of the population in Nicaragua and Honduras, 25% in Guatemala, and 20% in El Salvador), especially in the period before harvest (Dixon et al., 2001; Eitzinger et al., 2012). Coffee farmers typically experience higher incomes per unit of land than maize and bean producers. Coffee and small-scale vegetable production provide important income sources. 

Public infrastructure is sparse or completely absent away from local administrative centres and road networks are largely inadequate. In El Salvador, the road network is usable only during the dry season, greatly restricting access to land and markets (Eitzinger et al., 2012). However, the rural access index (RAI) varies by country, for example, Bolivia's RAI is 48%, Costa Rica at 82% and Nicaragua at 28% (Perez, 2020). Similarly, the availability of education, health care and other services is generally poor. Although, levels of education vary between smallholder farmers in different landscapes. For example, Costa Rican farmers generally have higher levels of education than farmers in Guatemala and Honduras, and El Salvador has lower education levels than Honduras (Eitzinger et al., 2012). Most smallholder land ownership is by customary arrangement, making access to formal credit  difficult. To compensate, rural communities rely on social cohesion, enabling community mobilisation for a wide range of activities (Dixon et al., 2001). "
"Irrigated (LAC)",,"Arid and semi-arid","200"," "," "," "," "," "," ","Irrigated","The irrigated agricultural system covers large areas of arid land in Northern and Central Mexico and coastal and inland valley areas of Peru, Chile and Western Argentina. The total land area is close to 200 million ha (Dixon et al., 2001). As the name suggests, the agricultural system is irrigated, which allows for a relatively high degree of intensification. The system is commercially oriented involving the production of fruit, rice, cotton, horticulture and vines. Poverty levels in the irrigated agricultural system are generally low to moderate (Dixon et al., 2001).

In Chile, approximately 52% of the coast is irrigated, with irrigation efficiency low at around 35–40% (World Bank et al., 2015). The main irrigation system used is gravitational flooding, which has a low irrigation efficiency (30%). The second-most adopted irrigation type is micro-irrigation (23%), followed by sprinkler irrigation (5%) (Donosa, 2021). The main irrigated crops in Central Chile are maize, rice, blueberries, raspberries, and perennials, such as apple and cherry trees. Fruit production, such as grape and avocado, are typically exported (Peña-Guerrero et al., 2020). Irrigated agriculture exerts considerable pressure on the country’s water resources, especially in the coastal areas.

In the northern areas of the Peru coastline, irrigated agricultural production includes the cultivation of asparagus, artichokes, peppers, avocados, pineapples, mangos and blueberries (Portugal, 2019). These products, destined for export markets, have resulted in agricultural expansion and an increased demand for irrigation. Investments in modern irrigation infrastructure by large-scale farms have increased groundwater abstraction (Salmoral et al., 2020). There is a clear difference in the level of modernisation between agro-export farms, which typically use automated high-efficiency drip irrigation systems, and small-scale farms that rely on low energy, lower efficiency surface irrigation systems. Small-scale farmers tend to obtain their water from surface water sources as they lack access to finance to drill boreholes or increase the depths of existing boreholes/wells to draw upon the falling water table (Salmoral et al., 2020). 

As in Peru and Chile, in Argentina, the irrigated farming system has allowed for the intensification and commercialisation of agricultural production, such as grape production (World Bank et al., 2014). In Mexico, the key fruits and vegetables grown for export markets include bell pepper, onion, spinach, cucumber, mango, papaya, banana and avocado. Increased demand for irrigation in conjunction with climate change has led to aquifer overexploitation and declines in regional groundwater levels."

"Dryland mixed (MENA)",,"Semiarid- subhumid","42","3,84","2,59"," "," "," ","7","Rainfed","The dryland mixed agricultural system of the Middle East and North Africa region covers an area of 42 million hectares and is located in the semi-arid subhumid agroecological zone which receives an annual rainfall of between 150 mm to 300 mm (Dixon et al., 2001). The agricultural area of the system is 3.8 million hectares (Hyman et al., 2016). Drought is a frequent occurrence in the region and food insecurity is particularly challenging (Dixon et al., 2001; Hyman et al., 2016). Soils in the region’s more arid areas are susceptible to wind erosion (Dixon et al., 2001; OECD/FAO, 2018). 
Crop production is rainfed and vulnerable to inter-annual and seasonal variation (temporal and spatial). Barley and wheat are the predominant crops and are grown in rotation with an annual or two-year fallow period (Dixon et al., 2001). Indigenous barley varieties are becoming increasingly popular and frequently replace wheat production. The cultivation of higher value crops, such as fruits and vegetables, tends to be constrained by low rainfall and poor market linkages (Hyman et al., 2016). Legumes (lentils and chickpeas) are grown in areas with higher rainfall.
Livestock production, including cattle and small ruminants, is integrated in cropping systems (Dixon et al., 2001). Sheep and goats are by far the most numerous livestock species, with sheep numbers generally exceeding those of goats (Mohamed et al., 2019). When yields are good, barley is produced for grain and sheep are grazed on the stubble of the harvested crop. However, if rainfall is low and the crop does not reach maturation, the whole crop may be used for livestock fodder. Sheep breeds are typically hardy, small, and able to withstand adverse conditions and survive on sub-maintenance diets (Mohamed et al., 2019). Farmers are reliant on livestock production for subsistence and cash income.
The population density of the agricultural system is lower than those in more arable systems and farms are typically small (Dixon et al., 2001; OECD/FAO, 2018). Poverty is extensive amongst small-scale farmers. Land and water are scarce in the region and the environment makes agriculture a challenging pursuit, thus migration to urban areas is increasing with remittances crucial to food security in rural communities (Dixon et al., 2001; OECD/FAO, 2018). "
"Highland Mixed (MENA)",,"Semiarid - subhumid","74",,,,,,"4","Rainfed","The highland mixed farming system  covers an area of 74 million ha. The annual rainfall experienced is between 200 and 800mm and the agrisystem falls under the semiarid - subhumid agroecological zone. The system depends upon the exploitation of high altitude arable and common grazing lands where cold winters lead to dormancy or very slow growth of crops and fodder species. There is a strong interaction between crop and livestock production (Dixon et al., 2001)

Climate change and increased temperatures impact the agrisystem and the associated water towers would become more fragile, with reduced water yield, recurrent drought and extreme events. There is a need for collective action for coordinated management of upstream and downstream systems for mutual benefit. Investment is required to enhance productivity to feed the growing population while maintaining/improving the ecosystem services. Targeted support is needed for system integration and resilience, including policies and strategies to add value and link mountain produce with niche markets, thereby facilitating positive livelihood change (Dixon et al., 2001)

The highland mixed farming system contains very fragile ecosystems, where rural poverty is high and about 37 per cent of the population lives on a daily income of less than $1.25USD per day. The mountainous areas are usually far away from government power and receive limited policy attention. Besides climate change risks, the system is prone to water erosion. Deforestation has been a major cause of resource degradation, reduced crop and livestock productivity, and reduced water yields. On the other hand, this system has high potential, with high rainfall, a favourable climate, distinct biodiversity and opportunities for green energy. A well-managed highland system would benefit downstream communities and beyond: economic growth and sustainability of downstream systems depend hugely on resources coming from the mountains (Dixon et al., 2001)"
"Rainfed Mixed (MENA)",,"Dry-moist subhumid","17"," "," "," "," "," ","5","Rainfed ","The rainfed mixed farming system in Middle East and North Africa supports one fifth of all farm households within the region covering an area of 17 million ha, giving rise to population densities similar to those of the irrigated system. Producers are typically owner-occupiers or tenants. Annual rainfall is between 300 and 1000 mm and the growing period ranges from 180 to 365 days. A wide diversity of crops and trees are grown in well-established patterns around settlements. The rainfed mixed farming system falls under the dry-moist subhumid agro-ecological zone (Dixon et al., 2001).

Many farms are intensively capitalised with a high level of inputs, and farmers are very sensitive to market opportunities. There are a number of specialised dairy and poultry enterprises within the system. In the drier areas, cereals become more dominant and there is often a greater interdependence among farming families who frequently share resources and equipment. Farm systems are diversified and there is a seasonal interaction with livestock (mainly sheep and goat) owners in the use of crop residues and other fodder (Dixon et al., 2001).

A typical system farm manages about five ha in several parcels of land of different quality around the village. Cereals (about three ha) and legumes are managed collectively in blocks to aid mechanisation of operations and post-harvest grazing management. The farm has small areas of olives, fruits and vines. A cow and a few sheep are kept around the village. Off-farm income is substantial, mostly from seasonal employment in the city (Dixon et al., 2001).

The principal trends and issues concern the poor access to quality land faced by increasing numbers of small farmers; soil erosion on slopes during rainstorms and erosion by wind on light, over-cultivated, exposed soils; and increasing attempts by farmers to diversify crops. Strategies and policies of research and extension institutions are not addressing the main needs of small farmers. Other trends include the decreasing proportion of wheat and the greater use of legumes in the rotation, increasing farm size and mechanisation (including the rapidly rising use of supplementary irrigation), migration to urban areas and growing dependence on off-farm income to secure food and livelihood security. Women are becoming increasingly marginalised in the production process and their labour is being progressively displaced, as men dominate the mechanisation processes for all the main crops (Dixon et al., 2001)."
"Rainfed Mixed ",,"Dry Subhumid",,,," "," "," ","3","rainfed","The Rainfed Mixed Farming System covers nearly 30 percent of the land in South Asia, almost entirely within Central and Southern India, although there is a small area in Northern Sri Lanka. The total area under the rainfed mixed farming system is 147 m ha. The system is under the dry subhumid agroecological zone. The system is not supported by any large irrigation system, but in many instances relatively small areas irrigated from tanks reduce vulnerability to drought and permit dry season cropping. This traditional tank-based supplemental system has been further enlarged in recent decades by the use of tubewells (Dixon et l., 2001)

Livestock are an important part of the farming system - which supports the largest share of cattle, sheep and goats in the region - and they usually provide the major part of the farm family's cash income, particularly through sales of adult animals or young stock, since most areas are too remote for commercial milk production. As infrastructure improves, however, dairy production is becoming more important in some areas. There is also production of cereals, legumes and fodder which is also dominant in the Agrisystem (Dixon et al., 2001)

Since the farming system depends for its survival on rainfall and possibly groundwater, appropriate measures are required in the upper catchments to make sure that tree cover is adequate to reduce run-off and to encourage infiltration and percolation that can recharge local aquifers. Improvements to the system will require inputs from a spectrum of disciplines, including irrigation engineering, forestry, fodder production, livestock husbandry and horticulture, in addition to traditional arable crop agronomy. The introduction of horticulture and fruit crops has historically been constrained by remoteness from markets. This can be overcome in areas where there is some comparative advantage for fruit and vegetable production, if private sector interest in establishing processing plants can be generated (Dixon et al., 2001)

Some research stations claim to have developed packages of practices suitable for this rainfed farming system. In general, adoption of these recommendations is disappointingly low, but this can be explained by farmer's aversion to risk, or by shortage of labour or other resources to implement improvements. Successful projects or programmes of assistance need to have a wider focus, rather than merely being concentrated on agriculture-related measures. Provision of reliable drinking water is generally the first priority need in these areas. Other social services including health clinics and primary schools, are also normally lacking (Dixon et al., 2001)"
"Rice-wheat (SA)",,"Dry subhumid","97"," "," "," "," "," ","5,6","Irrigated ","The rice–wheat agricultural system extends from Northern Pakistan, through the Indo-Gangetic Plain and the Terai region of Nepal, the Gangetic Plain in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal, and culminates in Northwest Bangladesh (Dixon et al., 2001). Around 85% of the agricultural system is located within the Indo-Gangetic Plain (Dhanda et al., 2022). It is the largest agricultural system in the world, occupying around 12.3M ha in India, 0.5M ha in Nepal, 2.2M ha in Pakistan and 0.8M ha in Bangladesh (Bhatt et al., 2016; Mishra et al., 2021).  The system is characterised by a summer (monsoon-season) wetland rice crop and a winter (cool, dry season) wheat crop, which is occasionally followed by a short springtime vegetable crop. The agricultural system also contains large populations of cattle, sheep and goats which graze on crop residues and return to the uplands during the cropping season (Dixon et al., 2001). Rice-wheat production is an important livelihood source for millions of farmers in the region and feeds over a billion people (Arshad et al., 2016).

Rice is conventionally grown by manually transplanting seedlings (aged 25–30 days) into puddled soil during the wet season (June to October). Puddling requires 200-250 mm of water (Rashid et al., 2018).  In winter (November-March), wheat is grown with repeated dry tillage and broadcasting of wheat seeds (Paudel et al., 2020). After the wheat crop is harvested, fields are left fallow for summer (April-June). Summer ploughing is undertaken to destroy weeds (Mishra et al., 2021). Residue from the rice crop interferes with tillage and sowing operations of
the successive wheat crop, and so farmers tend to burn it. Irrigation using groundwater is common in the agricultural system. The rapid expansion in the number of private tubewells in conjunction with difficulties surrounding the regulation of water use has led to depleted aquifers and the lowering of groundwater tables (Bhatt et al., 2021; Dixon et al., 2001; Mishra et al., 2021).  For example, in some parts of Pakistan and India, groundwater tables are declining by 1.0–3.5 m and 6 m/ annum, respectively. The rice-wheat agricultural system is water, labour and energy intensive (Ullah et al., 2021). 

Within the agricultural system, poverty and food insecurity are widespread, affecting mainly landless agricultural workers and sharecroppers (Dixon et al., 2001). For example, smallholder farmers in the Indo-Gangetic Plain generate per capita incomes of USD 835 per household per annum (national (India) average of USD 1,256)(Mishra et al., 2021). Poverty and food insecurity are expected to worsen as the yields of the rice-wheat agricultural system are declining. The declining yields have been attributed to unsustainable farming practices, slow maturing traditional varieties, soil degradation, decreasing groundwater levels, increasing average temperatures, high prevalence of invasive plant species and outbreaks of pests and diseases. Due to the high demand for labour, water, and energy, the sustainability of the rice-wheat agricultural system is now under question.

"Rice (SA)",,"Humid","36"," "," "," "," "," ","0,65","Rainfed and irrigated","The rice agricultural system covers approximately 7% of South Asia, comprising areas in Southern Bangladesh and South Punjab, coastal zones in Tamil Nadu and Kerala and Sri Lanka. The system is diverse, transitioning to the rice-wheat system to the north, and the southern areas integrate aquaculture, and large numbers of cattle and poultry. Most farmers are tenants and sharecroppers who farm small areas of land (0.3 ha to 1 ha), with a few medium to large owner-operated farms ranging from between 4 ha to greater than 10 ha in size (Dixon et al., 2001). 

Rice is grown in the wet season, with a second rice crop, or a less water-intensive crop such as coarse grains, oil seeds, legumes or vegetables cultivated in the dry season (Dixon et al., 2001). Supplementary irrigation is applied in the monsoon season and full irrigation in the dry season.
 
Off-farm employment is common due to proximity to urban areas and is important for ensuring household food security. In general, extension services are well established due to the importance of rice as a food staple and production areas being easily accessible (Dixon et al., 2001). The uptake of improved seed has been slow, this is mainly due to its poorer taste, inaccessibility, lower tolerance to early or late transplanting, and only marginal increases in yield. The agricultural system also integrates significant numbers of cattle including dairy animals (due to the proximity to large urban centres). Fodder is limited so cattle are fed paddy straw (Dixon et al., 2001).

Households tend to depend on incomes from rice production, and so are vulnerable to fluctuating yields and losses in flood and cyclone prone areas. The vulnerability of smallholder farmers is high due to a lack of access to government safety nets and inadequate employment guarantee schemes. Poor smallholder farmers are often as vulnerable as landless rural workers (Dixon et al., 2001)."
"Agropastoral",,"Tropical warm semi-arid","443","66,45","72,1","8,86","193,9","98,4"," ","Rainfed;Irrigated","The agropastoral farming system is predominant in the semi-arid regions of western, central, eastern and southern Africa covering twenty-five African countries. The system extends over 443 million ha and hosts a population of about 193 million people (Dixon et al., 2020). The sub systems support extensive livestock production, game ranching and drought tolerant crops such as sorghum and millets (Dixon et al., 2020).
The system is characterized by high climate variabilities including high temperatures, unpredictable rainfall and prolonged drought (Dixon et al., 2020; CIAT and USAID, 2016; Tremblay, 2016; UNHCR, 2022; Herrero et al., 2016; Kandji et al., 2006; Kirby, 2022).  These climatic risks significantly increase crop failure and reduced livestock productivity (Thornton et al., 2009; Dixon et al., 2020; Herrero et al., 2016). The climate risks coupled with other vulnerabilities increase competition for and this shapes local land management systems and livelihoods (Dixon et al., 2020; Herrero et al., 2016). 
 Other challenges affecting the system include high population growth rates, land use saturation, decline of fallowing practices, large youth employment gaps, climate change, as well as land and resource access and tenure constraints especially for women (Thornton et al., 2009; Dixon et al., 2020; Herrero et al., 2016).

"Cereal-root crop mixed (SSA)",,"Tropical warm subhumid","202","33,6","29","0,27","85","43","4.3","Rainfed","The cereal-root crop mixed farming system  extends in a band across central Africa from Senegal and Guinea through northern Côte d’Ivoire to Ghana, Togo, Benin, Nigeria, northern Cameroon, the southern part of Chad, across the northern part of Central African Republic and southern Sudan (Amir Kassam et al., 2022).
The farming system has a warm tropical climate, an annual rainfall of 800 to 1200 mm, and a length of growing period ranging from 150 to 240 days. There is considerable excess of rainfall over evapotranspiration during the growing period so that the risk of severe drought is relatively low. However, devastating droughts have occurred in the past in the dry sub-humid parts of the zone, such as in 1930, 1972 and more recently.
The farming system is located between the agropastoral farming system to the north with rainfall less than 800 mm, and the root crop farming system to the south with more than 1200 mm rainfall. In Dixon et al., (2001), the cereal-root crop mixed farming system occurred in parts of southern, central and eastern Africa. However, as farmers increased the area of maize in the system during the period 2000–2015, in some areas the cereal-root crop mixed farming system has evolved into the maize mixed farming system while still retaining some small pockets with cassava, sweet potato, sorghum and millet (Dixon et al., 2001; FAO 2008) .
In 2015 the total population of the cereal-root mixed farming system was 84.8 million, representing rapid annual growth since 2000, and estimated to grow to about 168 million by 2040. Approximately 50 per cent of the population were involved in agriculture. Total cultivated area was 33.6 million ha, of which cereals (sorghum, millet, maize and rice) constituted two-thirds of the total, while root and tuber crops (cassava, sweet potato, yam) amounted to nearly 3 million ha.
In most of the countries, the farming system is regarded as the ‘grain’ belt and is often referred to as the ‘bread basket’. This is because the system has high agroecological potential for crop and livestock production, with the best moisture, solar radiation and thermal regime for tropical cereals such as maize, sorghum and millet (Amir Kassam et al., 2022).

"Highland temperate mixed",,"Sub humid","53","13","28","0,2","73","44,5","1,6","Rainfed","The highland mixed farming system is predominant in the north-western, eastern, south-western and southern African highlands at an elevation of more than 1700 m above sea level. It covers regions in Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia, Ethiopia, Lesotho, Cameroon, Nigeria, Angola, Eritrea, Mozambique, South Africa and Zimbabwe (Dixon et al., 2020). The highlands are home to 73 million people on about 53 million hectares of land (Dixon et al., 2020). The average farm size is about 1.6 ha per household and about 0.3 ha per person, however the farm size varies with Lesotho and Cameroon reaching 3 ha per head (Shiferaw et al. 2013; Dixon et al., 2020).
The system is characterised by sub humid climate and mountainous and rugged terrain.  The average annual rainfall is 1155 mm and temperatures range from 8–22°C in the lower elevations and 10–12°C in the higher elevations (Dixon et al., 2020).  However Lesotho in the south has a temperate climate with temperatures ranging from −12 to +35°C(Dixon et al., 2020). The highlands are considered good for agricultural production owing to the good soils which are mostly young, well drained and deep.
 Crop and livestock production are the dominant livelihood practices across all the highlands. Subsistence crop and livestock practices are common in most areas and only few pockets are commercially oriented (Dixon et al., 2020). The system is sub-divided into four sub-systems namely; highland livestock-cereal, highland wheat-pulse, highland maize-based and highland mixed North African which are majorly differentiated by socioeconomic and agroecological factors (Dixon et al., 2020). 
Despite the high agricultural potential, the system is characterised by limited human and financial capital, low input use, poor market access and inadequate infrastructure (Dixon et al., 2020; Herrero and Thornton 2011). Other constraining factors include; high population density and growth, severe soil erosion, farm fragmentation, a declining land holding per capita, declining soil fertility and overstocking (Dixon et al., 2020)."
"Highland Perennial",,"Tropical cool subhumid","39,3","8"," ","0,77","82,5","61","0,7","Rainfed;Irrigated","The highland perennial system is characterised by a mountainous terrain. The system is essentially located in tropical cool subhumid zones in East Africa covering Congo (DRC), Rwanda, Burundi, Uganda, Tanzania, Kenya and Ethiopia.  The system is suitable for crops such as horticulture, floriculture, coffee and tea, as well as for dairy (CIAT, 2011; Dixon et al., 2020).  The system is divided into six sub-systems namely; southern Ethiopia, Albertine Rift, northern Tanzania and southern Tanzania, central Kenya and western Kenya.
The average farm size per household is 0.7 ha but this varies across the subsystems. Human population is over 80 million and the population density is associated with the declining average farm size (Dixon et al., 2020). Southern Ethiopia is the most densely populated while Southern Tanzania is the least populated (Dixon et al., 2020). Over 50% of the population is classified as poor and is highly vulnerable to climate change impacts (Dixon et al., 2020; FAO, 2015).
  The system contributes significantly to rural economy, but its growth is limited by declining farm sizes. Potential pathways for the system include intensification and as well market integration and commercialisation (Dixon et al., 2020; FAO, 2015). Thus, there are opportunities for improving productivity in the highland perennial system although the system will continue being largest source of rural-urban migration in East Africa (Dixon et al., 2020)."
"Mixed Maize",,"Tropical subhumid","361","40","36","1,9","181","107","2,1","rainfed; irrigated","The maize mixed farming system is predominant in the sub-humid agroecological zone of eastern, central and southern Africa.  The system extends across plateau and highland areas at altitudes of approximately 800 to 1500 metres, from Ethiopia, Kenya and Tanzania to Zambia, Malawi, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Swaziland and Lesotho with low altitude extensions into central Africa (including the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)) and Madagascar.
In addition to maize, the sub-humid agroecological system supports livestock production, trees, tuber crops and cash crops (Dixon et al., 2020).  Cash crops include coffee, tobacco, cotton, groundnuts, vegetables and livestock products. The system hosts an agricultural population of over over 100 million with an average holding of 2.1 ha. (Dixon et al., 2020). Despite the system being referred as the food basket and a driver of rural economic growth, poverty prevalence is higher than in other farming systems in Africa.
Market access is reasonable for many areas, and this supports commercialisation of the surplus produce. Cultivation is also increasingly becoming mechanised even though use of hands hoes and animal draught are also common practices (Dixon et al., 2020).
 The system is affected by land degradation due to poor management practices and prolonged use of inorganic fertilisers.  Climatic hazards particularly increase in temperatures and decline in precipitation are associated with reduced yields of maize and other crops, especially in southern Africa (Dixon et al., 2020; Verhage et al., 2018; USAID, 2016). Agricultural intensification and diversification as well as improve policy and institution environment can potentially improve the productivity of this system ((Dixon et al., 2020).; CIAT and World Bank, 2017)"

 The system consists of livestock and drylands crop-based production that supports an agricultural population of 38 million (Dixon et al., 2020). Poverty affects about 40% of the average per capita livestock holdings is TLU 0.97 in the Sahel, 0.61 in eastern Africa and 1.50 in southern Africa (Dixon et al., 2020; Zougmore et al., 2016).
In addition, human population growth drives pastoral poverty, as many pastoralists have insufficient livestock to sustain a livelihood based on livestock only (Dixon et al., 2020). Intensification, market opportunities and opportunities outside the system such as education and job creation could benefit the poor. 
Climate change impacts the system in various ways and extreme drought events exacerbate the vulnerability of the pastoral populations (Funk et al., 2012; Zougmore et al., 2016; Thornton et al., 2009; Filho et al., 2020).  Other non-climatic factors include underdeveloped markets, weak land tenure and water management policies (Dixon et al., 2020; OECD, 2008). "

The dominant crops are cassava and yam, but also has some tree crops (e.g. oil palm, cocoa, rubber, cashew and mangoes), cereals (e.g. rice, maize, sorghum and millet) but few livestock (Dixon et al., 2020). 
Approximately 30 per cent of all cassava grown and marketed in Africa is cultivated in the root and tuber crop farming system and it’s the most important food staple in nearly two-thirds of the countries in Africa (Sagoe, 2006; USAID, 2017; Dixon et al., 2020; Ferraro et al., 2015).

Though in early stage of development, the farming system is highly diverse and complex with stable and relatively high potential food productivity (Dixon et al., 2020).  The system mainly focused on subsistence farming household food security.  Total cultivated area is nearly 23 million ha, of which little is irrigated. Markets are generally poorly developed and farm sizes are usually less than 2 ha (Dixon et al., 2020).  The root and tuber crops are mainly produced and processed by women.  Land tenure security for especially women limits credit and investments in the system.
The root and tuber crop farming system occupies a total estimated area of 236 million ha,and supports about 112 million people. Population growth is high and extreme poverty is relatively high; about half the rural population live on less than US$1.25 per day (Sagoe, 2006; Dixon et al., 2020)."
