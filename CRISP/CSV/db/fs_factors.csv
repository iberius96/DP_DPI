"Rising sea levels","The tides are rising at a rate close to ~2 cm/year, and salinity has increased by approximately 0.2–0.5 PSU/year.  Sea levels are expected to rise in the region by 45-75 cm by 2090.  Average sea level rise of 3 mm per year over the last 30 years . This is a major threat to a part of the world which, on average, is less than 2 metres above sea level.","EAP_Lowland_Rice"
"Increase in drought events","The risk of drought often occurs during the Winter-Spring rice crops, particularly in El Niño years. Severe drought years such as 1977–1978, 1997–1998, 2015–2016 and 2019–2020 are all related to El Niño events,","EAP_Lowland_Rice"
,"which greatly affect production and life in the Mekong Delta. During low river flow periods, between March and April, saline water intrudes up to 40–50 km inland from estuaries through main river systems  and about 100,000 ha of rice annually is at high risk of dry-season salinity intrusion.",
"Increase in average precipitation","In recent years, farmers in many provinces have had to readjust the crop calendar, to rotate rice with short-term crops, or to convert their rice land to aquaculture. It is worth noting that the rate of increase in aquaculture area in the Mekong Delta experienced an important surge after El Ninõ 2015–2016 (mean annual increase of 18.3 T ha in 2016–2019, as compared to 4.25 T ha in 2008–2015). Rainfall has increased at the end of the rainy season but decreased at the beginning of the rainy season over the last 10 years. Shifting rainfall patterns such as these can have an adverse effect on the agricultural productivity of the Mekong Delta. A 30% annual increase in precipitation has been observed.","EAP_Lowland_Rice"
"Decrease in average precipitation","The temperature has increased, annual rainfall has decreased and is distributed less evenly, and the dry season lasts longer. Results indicate a significant downward trend in rainfall in the Kien Giang, Soc Trang, and Ca Mau provinces, where the rice-growing areas are mainly based on rainfall. Therefore, these areas have a potential risk of water shortages, resulting in increased production costs especially during the winter-spring crop season, and a rice productivity decline, which would indirectly contribute to threatening the food security of the region and Vietnam as a whole.","EAP_Lowland_Rice"
"Saline intrusion","The risks of increasing saline intrusion and permanent inundation due to sea level rise, will significantly reduce the land suitable for rice cultivation in the Mekong delta by 50 % by 2050. Coastal provinces are strongly affected by saline intrusion from the second half of December to the end of April. Recently, saline intrusions tend to occur earlier, with increased salinity concentrations and duration, and are more invasive in the fields. Salinity intrusion is associated with low water discharge from upstream of the Mekong River.","EAP_Lowland_Rice"
,"This is caused by the below average rainfall in the Mekong basin due to the El Niño. With insufficient upstream water flow to push back seawater, salinity intrusion increased in concentration and duration. It was also aggravated by the drought and high temperature in the region. Salinity intrusion is also caused by the construction of dams further upstream on the Mekong River and dams on the lower Mekong River, which reduce water flow and prevent the renewal of the delta silt deposits.",
"Shorter growing seasons","In recent years, farmers in many provinces have had to readjust the crop calendar, to rotate rice with short-term crops, or to convert their rice land to aquaculture. It is worth noting that the rate of increase in aquaculture area in the Mekong Delta experienced an important surge after El Ninõ 2015–2016 (mean annual increase of 18.3 T ha in 2016–2019, as compared to 4.25 T ha in 2008–2015).","EAP_Lowland_Rice"
"Increased flooding","Seasonal river flooding, which coincides with the rainy season that runs from May to November, plays a critical role in the health of the Mekong river system. These floods deposit sediments, which improve soil fertility, flush out polluted waters, and recharge the groundwater tables. However, excessive flooding during the rainy season are becoming more frequent, and structural elements are not expected to hold up under an increasingly severe climate regime, which is driving sea-level rise (SLR) and changing meteorological and hydrological conditions.","EAP_Lowland_Rice"
,"Chnages in climate are also causing flooding and drought in Lao PDR ",
"Water scarcity","The Mekong Delta is one of a number of localised agricultural regions in the world that face acute water risks, which we have identified as water-risk “hotspots” that require a targeted policy response. These water risks are not only the result of climate change but involve a range of factors, including farming itself, that cause water shortages, floods and degradation of water quality, extensive dam-building and ground water pumping.","EAP_Lowland_Rice"
"Reduced crop productivity/failure","Climate change by 2050 will cause a significant reduction in rice yield, but the projections  depend on the rice crop season and the geographical area. Vast tracks of land planted with rice are affected by salinity intrusion and drought at the reproductive stage. Yields were reduced by 50-100%, or total loss. Shifting rainfall patterns  have an adverse effect on the agricultural productivity of the Mekong Delta.  Estimates of changes in crop productivity due","EAP_Lowland_Rice"

New Zealand Embassy announced humanitarian aid, totalling US$50,000, to communities in Ben Tre Province affected by drought and saltwater intrusion.","EAP_Lowland_Rice"
"Limited uptake of modern technologies","The capacity of agencies to provide accurate information for drought and salinity forecasting and early warning systems is limited. The distribution of updated information on salinity levels is slow. In Vietnam, it takes a long time until salinity measurements reach the farmers. Collected information has to first be elevated to and approved by high-level decision makers before it is distributed to the local level. Thus, farmers get outdated information on salinity.

"Fragmented landscapes","Increasing fragmentation of farmland has resulted from a growing agricultural population and the absence of primogeniture to maintain the integrity of holdings. In many instances farm sizes are now uneconomic, and even with the adoption of best practices would still only be marginal in terms of livelihood. If this trend is not reversed, an increasing proportion of farmers will be unable to rely on agriculture to ensure adequate food security and income levels.

"Improve access to climate information services","Existing national, regional and provincial salinity information systems are effective for managing irrigation infrastructure to access both saline and fresh water at the macro level. However information is insufficient to warn rice growers in time when water management infrastructure fails or is unable to protect their fields. If farmers measure and disseminate information about salinity variability in their immediate environment in cooperation with local authorities, communities can make collective decisions and put strategies in place to minimize the risks of salinity intrusion in their rice fields.

In addition, technology development typically focuses on specific commodities, rather than on integrated development of a system  that takes into account various land use options and different agro-ecological zones. ","EAP Upland Intensive Mixed"
"Unsustainable land management practices","Shifting cultivation has historically been the main land use system of upland rural villages. Two to ten year rotations are applied and the major crop, upland rice, is cultivated with no external inputs or mechanisation. However, this is changing in many areas as farming is becoming market-oriented with shorter fallow periods, some permanent fields, and the use of irrigation and inputs. With the more intensive production and shorter fallow periods, soil fertility is declining and production is being adversely affected, rendering the system ecologically unsustainable. This change has come about mainly due to demographic pressure and land-use restrictions. ","EAP Upland Intensive Mixed"
"Unequal opportunities for women ","Women tend to be marginalised in the upland intensive mixed agricultural system despite the vital role they play. Traditionally, women are responsible for tasks such as transplanting, weeding and harvesting, while men work in land preparation, crop management and marketing. Women are often excluded from decision-making roles and are paid less than men for the same work. Further, land ownership by women is rare, so their work is largely unrecognised.","EAP Upland Intensive Mixed"

Documentation skills are lacking and there is limited sharing of research data and results. For example, the  quality of upland rice production data for Laos is insufficient to inform decision making. ","EAP Upland Intensive Mixed"
"Low access to agricultural extension services","Access to agricultural extension services is generally low in the agricultural system due to the large number of poor farmers with small plots in geographically dispersed communities with underdeveloped transport and communication infrastructure. The lack of access to extension services affects knowledge sharing on modern agricultural technology and practices. Women are typically excluded from access to critical productive resources such as  extension services and information.","EAP Upland Intensive Mixed"
"Lack of access to  inputs ","Due to the remoteness and widespread poverty within the agricultural system, farmers tend to lack capital for seeds, fertilisers, pesticides and wages to hire workers to plant and harvest crops. Women are typically excluded from access to critical productive resources and services such as credit, farm inputs, marketing facilities, extension and information.","EAP Upland Intensive Mixed"
"Low level of education","Due to the remoteness of the upland intensive mixed farming system, education levels are generally low as school attendance requires commuting. For example the household heads of two villages engaged in upland agriculture in Laos, namely, Ko Ngiaw and Navene, 43% and 21% had completed secondary-level education, respectively. It was noted that the farmers with higher levels of education possessed greater adaptive capacity.","EAP Upland Intensive Mixed"
"Low levels of climate change awareness at the farmer level","In general, farmers in South East Asia are aware of climate change due to information gathered from newspapers, the internet, television, advertisements, and their community and friends.

"Capacity building on sustainable agricultural practices","Sustainable soil and water management practices should be promoted to improve crop yields and ensure maintenance of soil productivity.","EAP Upland Intensive Mixed"
"Implement agroforestry practices","Agroforestry is a key climate change adaptation strategy as it provides multiple harvests at different times of the year. The diverse combination of crops buffers farmers from the risk of income loss due to climate variability, price fluctuations and other unexpected problems. On steeper lands such as in the upland intensive mixed agricultural system, agroforestry should be promoted with contour planting of suitable tree species for production of fruits, timber, fuelwood and non-timber forest products.","EAP Upland Intensive Mixed"
"Plant multiple crop types","The planting of multiple crops, such as in agroforestry systems, shifts reliance from one or two annual crops to a range of food and income-generating crops, thus reducing vulnerability to climate shocks. Further, the planting of multiple crop types can reduce the incidence of pests and diseases.","EAP Upland Intensive Mixed"

"Weak land tenure ","Existing weak land tenure systems are key drivers of deforestation in the Amazon basin. ","LAC Forest based"
"Lack of coordination between national and local levels of government","A key challenge to scaling-up sustainable agricultural interventions is to integrate knowledge across multiple levels by devolving action from the national to the local level. This ensures that interventions are put in the local context and are therefore locally viable.","LAC Forest based"
"Policy promotes unsustainable land use ","Policy typically favours agricultural intensification and monocropping which contributes to deforestation. ","LAC Forest based"
"Low access to credit","Farmers in the Amazon region face high climate risk leading to credit default and poor credit histories, subsequently, financial institutions charge high interest rates and transaction fees. Where low interest loans are offered the amounts allocated are typically insufficient and quickly depleted.","LAC Forest based"
"Lack of incentives for sustainable production","Farmers in the Amazon region lack incentives to adopt sustainable land management practices. ","LAC Forest based"
"High levels of deforestation","Deforestation for cattle ranching pastures and crop cultivation (e.g. soybean and palm oil) is prevalent in Latin America. In Brazil, Bolivia, Peru and Colombia, the main cause of deforestation is agricultural expansion. Forest clearance for cattle pastures is the largest direct driver of deforestation on both small and large farms in the Brazilian Amazon. In Ecuador’s Amazon region, deforestation increased from 0.13% per annum in 2015 to 0.30% in 2017. In Colombia, deforestation increased by 14% between 2015 and 2016, and doubled between 2016 and 2017. In Brazil’s Legal Amazon, deforestation increased by 8.5% between 2017 and 2018.","LAC Forest based"

"Frequent forest fires","Fire is routinely used to clear forest for agricultural production, and in conjunction with increasing temperatures and drought, has been identified as a direct driver of deforestation in the Amazon. For example, in 2020, warm and dry conditions were experienced in the southern Amazon, resulting in 600,000 individual fire events, including 25 fires that were larger than 500 square kilometres in Bolivia, Brazil, and Paraguay. Deforestation fire activity increased in the southern Amazon area by 23% from 2019 to 2020, and active fire detections from understory fires were 60% higher than in 2019.","LAC Forest based"

"Implement agroforestry practices","Agroforestry is a valuable climate change adaptation option for forest-agriculture frontiers.  Agroforestry improves soil fertility, increases water availability, provides vegetation cover and maintains the microclimate. Furthermore, agroforestry has the potential to recover degraded lands and is an economically viable approach that can be integrated in grain, non-timber forest products and beef production systems. ","LAC Forest based"
"Implement climate smart agriculture practices","The climate smart agriculture practice of integrated crop–livestock management is a potential means to improve the productivity and sustainability of cattle production in the Amazon. For example, integrated soybean–cattle systems have higher productivity than continuously grazed areas. Silvopastoral systems are another climate smart approach to improving agricultural productivity. Silvopastoral systems provide shade, reducing body temperatures of grazing cattle by up to 4˚C compared with pasture-only systems. Some examples of climate smart pasture management options include not exceeding land carrying capacity, planting drought tolerant fodder crops (e.g. BRS Paiaguas), no tillage, intercropping of grasses and legumes for pasture diversification, and implementing manure management systems for improved soil quality.","LAC Forest based"
"Diversify to horticulture","Specialty crops such as citrus, black pepper, and vegetables were found to provide up to 10 times higher returns than other land uses in the Brazilian Amazon. However, such crops require good access to urban areas and processing, storage and supply infrastructure. Despite the potential long-term profitability, high start-up costs can restrict adoption by farmers.","LAC Forest based"
"Invest in agricultural research and development","Government agencies, researchers and civil society need to collaborate and hold dialogue on drivers of deforestation and forest degradation addressing climate change impacts and land use types. Rigorous research is needed to understand the impacts of climate change on forest-based agricultural systems and when and why producers adopt sustainable practices.","LAC Forest based"
"Capacity building on sustainable agricultural practices","Sustainable agricultural production in the Amazon region can be promoted by combining farmer training and education with technology and investment. Assistance in the form of technical education and access to financing for sustainable practices were identified as key to developing sustainable cattle supply chains.","LAC Forest based"

"Improve networking and knowledge exchange","Multi-sectoral partnerships in agricultural-forest frontiers should be established for improved social and environmental governance.  Participatory processes involving government agents, civil society and rural communities should be undertaken to improve the resilience of the agricultural system by drawing upon local knowledge. Failure to foster synergies and cooperation between the diverse set of stakeholders may result in missed opportunities to achieve more equitable land and resource use systems.","LAC Forest based"

For example, aqua-agro-silvo-pastoral systems can produce a wide range of products for local consumption as well as for market. This creates alternative livelihoods, which diminish household vulnerability to lower maize and bean production. Furthermore, improved integration of crops and animals can enhance nutrient cycling resulting in higher crop yields, better soil and water quality and increased biodiversity together with lower greenhouse gas emissions and increased carbon sequestration.","LAC Maize-beans"

"Risk to farmers of chronic poverty due to Climate Change "," In the highland mixed farming system the large population increase has led to a decline in forests, farm productivity and water availability, which has been leading communities to a downward spiral of poverty. In Ethiopia, there are high numbers of people still living in poverty and food insecurity, both chronic and acute. The population is concentrated in rural areas, and livelihoods are highly dependent on rain-fed agriculture, including both crop and livestock production. ","Highland temperate mixed"
"Risk to farmers of food insecurity due to Climate Change","The highland agro-ecologies, is persistently confronted with food insecurity, feed scarcity and land degradation. During heavy rains or drought periods, farmers become vulnerable to food and feed shortfalls.

If these mother bushes are damaged by hailstorms or frost, it can be difficult to find planting materials for nurseries. Frost also causes leaves to dry up on the bush. Because hailstorms are associated with heavy rains, they lead to  fertilizer leaching, which can increase input costs. Also, rising temperatures, erratic precipitation, and increasingly more extreme weather events are expected to affect the tea production in Kenya, leading to reduced crop yields.","SSA Highland Perennial"
