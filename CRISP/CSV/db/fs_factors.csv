2,"Rising sea levels","EAP_Lowland_Rice","Hazard","Maritime related","Maritime related","The tides are rising at a rate close to ~2 cm/year, and salinity has increased by approximately 0.2–0.5 PSU/year.  Sea levels are expected to rise in the region by 45-75 cm by 2090.  Average sea level rise of 3 mm per year over the last 30 years . This is a major threat to a part of the world which, on average, is less than 2 metres above sea level."
3,"Increase in drought events","EAP_Lowland_Rice","Hazard","Rainfall related","Rainfall related","The risk of drought often occurs during the Winter-Spring rice crops, particularly in El Niño years. Severe drought years such as 1977–1978, 1997–1998, 2015–2016 and 2019–2020 are all related to El Niño events, which greatly affect production and life in the Mekong Delta. During low river flow periods, between March and April, saline water intrudes up to 40–50 km inland from estuaries through main river systems  and about 100,000 ha of rice annually is at high risk of dry-season salinity intrusion."
4,"Increase in average precipitation","EAP_Lowland_Rice","Hazard","Rainfall related","Rainfall related","In recent years, farmers in many provinces have had to readjust the crop calendar, to rotate rice with short-term crops, or to convert their rice land to aquaculture. It is worth noting that the rate of increase in aquaculture area in the Mekong Delta experienced an important surge after El Ninõ 2015–2016 (mean annual increase of 18.3 T ha in 2016–2019, as compared to 4.25 T ha in 2008–2015). Rainfall has increased at the end of the rainy season but decreased at the beginning of the rainy season over the last 10 years. Shifting rainfall patterns such as these can have an adverse effect on the agricultural productivity of the Mekong Delta. A 30% annual increase in precipitation has been observed."
5,"Decrease in average precipitation","EAP_Lowland_Rice","Hazard","Rainfall related","Rainfall related","The temperature has increased, annual rainfall has decreased and is distributed less evenly, and the dry season lasts longer. Results indicate a significant downward trend in rainfall in the Kien Giang, Soc Trang, and Ca Mau provinces, where the rice-growing areas are mainly based on rainfall. Therefore, these areas have a potential risk of water shortages, resulting in increased production costs especially during the winter-spring crop season, and a rice productivity decline, which would indirectly contribute to threatening the food security of the region and Vietnam as a whole."
6,"Saline intrusion","EAP_Lowland_Rice","Impact","Biophysical","Biophysical","The risks of increasing saline intrusion and permanent inundation due to sea level rise, will significantly reduce the land suitable for rice cultivation in the Mekong delta by 50 % by 2050. Coastal provinces are strongly affected by saline intrusion from the second half of December to the end of April. Recently, saline intrusions tend to occur earlier, with increased salinity concentrations and duration, and are more invasive in the fields. Salinity intrusion is associated with low water discharge from upstream of the Mekong River. This is caused by the below average rainfall in the Mekong basin due to the El Niño. With insufficient upstream water flow to push back seawater, salinity intrusion increased in concentration and duration. It was also aggravated by the drought and high temperature in the region. Salinity intrusion is also caused by the construction of dams further upstream on the Mekong River and dams on the lower Mekong River, which reduce water flow and prevent the renewal of the delta silt deposits."
7,"Shorter growing seasons","EAP_Lowland_Rice","Impact","Biophysical","Biophysical","In recent years, farmers in many provinces have had to readjust the crop calendar, to rotate rice with short-term crops, or to convert their rice land to aquaculture. It is worth noting that the rate of increase in aquaculture area in the Mekong Delta experienced an important surge after El Ninõ 2015–2016 (mean annual increase of 18.3 T ha in 2016–2019, as compared to 4.25 T ha in 2008–2015)."
8,"Increased flooding","EAP_Lowland_Rice","Impact","Biophysical","Biophysical","Seasonal river flooding, which coincides with the rainy season that runs from May to November, plays a critical role in the health of the Mekong river system. These floods deposit sediments, which improve soil fertility, flush out polluted waters, and recharge the groundwater tables. However, excessive flooding during the rainy season are becoming more frequent, and structural elements are not expected to hold up under an increasingly severe climate regime, which is driving sea-level rise (SLR) and changing meteorological and hydrological conditions. Chnages in climate are also causing flooding and drought in Lao PDR "
9,"Water scarcity","EAP_Lowland_Rice","Impact","Biophysical","Biophysical","The Mekong Delta is one of a number of localised agricultural regions in the world that face acute water risks, which we have identified as water-risk “hotspots” that require a targeted policy response. These water risks are not only the result of climate change but involve a range of factors, including farming itself, that cause water shortages, floods and degradation of water quality, extensive dam-building and ground water pumping."
10,"Reduced crop productivity/failure","EAP_Lowland_Rice","Impact","Biophysical","Biophysical","Climate change by 2050 will cause a significant reduction in rice yield, but the projections  depend on the rice crop season and the geographical area. Vast tracks of land planted with rice are affected by salinity intrusion and drought at the reproductive stage. Yields were reduced by 50-100%, or total loss. Shifting rainfall patterns  have an adverse effect on the agricultural productivity of the Mekong Delta.  Estimates of changes in crop productivity due to climate change are in the range of 2-30% over a 20-30 year period."

23,"Limited uptake of modern technologies","EAP_Lowland_Rice","Vulnerability","Human capital, gender and agricultural knowledge","Human capacity, agri knowledge,weather and environment","The capacity of agencies to provide accurate information for drought and salinity forecasting and early warning systems is limited. The distribution of updated information on salinity levels is slow. In Vietnam, it takes a long time until salinity measurements reach the farmers. Collected information has to first be elevated to and approved by high-level decision makers before it is distributed to the local level. Thus, farmers get outdated information on salinity.

In many instances farm sizes are now uneconomic, and even with the adoption of best practices would still only be marginal in terms of livelihood. If this trend is not reversed, an increasing proportion of farmers will be unable to rely on agriculture to ensure adequate food security and income levels.

While research services and private companies have developed new crop varieties - including hybrids - with higher yield potential and better local adaptability, they are often unavailable to the majority of farmers or are unsuited to their production practices.
